## Using the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209)

The Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) is funded and supported by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board in conjunction with a range of industry and academic partners. AHDB first published the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) in May 2017, after taking over secretariat and governance for revisions from Defra in November 2014. Since its publication, recommendations have been revised with the latest independent research funded by AHDB and its partners. A list of updates is available at ahdb.org.uk/rb209 To improve the accessibility and relevance of the recommendations and information, the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) is published as seven sections that are updated individually: •	Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use •	Section 2: Organic materials •	Section 3: Grass and forage crops •	Section 4: Arable crops •	Section 5: Potatoes (content last updated 2021) •	Section 6: Vegetables and bulbs (content last updated 2021) •	Section 7: Fruit, vines and hops (content last updated 2017) This section (Section 3) provides guidance for grass and forage crops (in situ grazing or ensiling) and should be read in conjunction with Sections 1 and 2. For each crop, recommendations for nitrogen (N), phosphate (P2O5) and potash 25 (K2O) are given in kilograms per hectare (kg/ha). Magnesium (MgO), sulphur  2 (as SO) and sodium (as NaO) recommendations, also in kg/ha, are given 32 where these nutrients are needed. Recommendations are given for the rate and timing of nutrient application. The recommendations are based on the nutrient requirements of the crop being grown, while allowing for the nutrients supplied by the soil. Using the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209)

## Introduction

This section provides nutrient recommendations for both grass and forage crops. As with any crop, it is important to match nutrient inputs to the demands of the grass sward or forage crop. Doing this will increase nutrient use efficiency, optimise grassland productivity, prevent loss of excess nutrients to the environment and cut input costs by reducing the need for purchased fertilisers. For grass and forage crops, there are several factors that affect how efficiently nutrients are used by the plant. Nutrients applied through fertilisers or manures (especially nitrogen) will be used most effectively when there is: •	Good soil structure – compacted or poorly draining soils will hinder plant nutrient uptake and can increase gaseous release of nitrogen •	Balanced soil fertility – nutrient efficiency (particularly nitrogen) is higher when soils have optimal levels of phosphate, potash, magnesium and sulphur •	A moderate soil temperature – at low temperatures, nutrient uptake by the plant will diminish, leading to a higher risk of leaching •	Sufficient soil moisture – too much moisture will increase the risk of leaching losses, too little will curb plant growth and reduce nutrient uptake •	Optimum soil pH – very low or high soil pH will reduce the amount of nutrients available to the plant. Optimum soil pH for grassland is 6.0 for mineral soils, 5.7 for intermediate organic soils and 5.3 for peaty soils. Aim to raise pH to 0.2 units above the optimum •	Good sward composition – more productive sward species, e.g. perennial rye-grass and timothy, will be more responsive to fertiliser inputs It is important to plan the amount of grass and forage crop production that needs to be achieved in each field, remembering that nutrient applications may need to be adjusted for seasonal and weather conditions.

### Points to consider

•	Statutory rules that affect nutrient use apply in all parts of the UK. Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) rules apply in England and Scotland, with similar rules in Wales •	Also in England, Farming Rules for Water cover nutrient use generally but particularly the use of nitrogen and phosphate •	In Northern Ireland, Nutrient Action Programme (NAP) rules affect both nitrogen and phosphate use •	All relevant rules should be consulted at an early stage in nutrient management planning to ensure compliance. There can be closed periods and limitations on the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus applied in manufactured fertilisers and organic manures

<!-- Page 5 -->

## Checklist for decision-making

Before applying fertilisers to grassland or forage crops it is important to: 1. Carry out a soil test (page 7). 2. For each field, check the relevant regulations and rules for application rates and timing for organic materials and fertilisers (e.g. nitrate vulnerable zones) 3. Assess soil structure. 4. Ensure drainage systems are maintained and functioning correctly. 5. Calibrate the fertiliser spreader. 6. Calculate any nutrient available for additions of organic materials (Section 2: Organic materials). 7. Consider the environmental risks of fertiliser or organic manure use, e.g. connectivity of field to water or proximity of sensitive habitat. 8. Keep good records of organic materials and fertiliser applications across the farm.

## Grass and forage requirements

Well-managed grass remains the cheapest feed available to livestock farms. However, to make the most of this resource, it is important to know: •	How much grass the farm is capable of producing •	How much grass must be produced to meet livestock requirements The recommendations presented in this guide use target dry matter yield to help determine the amount of nutrient required.

### Further information

Planning grazing strategies for Better Returns ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/planning-grazing-strategies-for- better-returns

### Points to consider

•	Nitrogen response occurs in two stages: firstly, nitrogen is taken up rapidly and secondly, dry matter yield increases •	Nitrogen uptake is more rapid than yield increase and is less affected by some adverse conditions, such as short day length. It is necessary, therefore, to distinguish greening of grass (associated with nitrogen uptake) from actual growth

<!-- Page 6 -->

## Measuring grass yield

Measuring on-farm grass production in terms of dry matter yield is an essential component of any efficient livestock system. It can also be a useful tool in deciding the target grass dry matter yield which, in turn, will help identify the appropriate nitrogen recommendation. Various methods exist to measure dry matter yield production across a season. For grazed fields, these include: •	Rising plate meter •	Sward stick •	Cut and weight (quadrat measurements) For silage fields, cuts can be used to determine grass dry matter yield using trailer-mounted weigh cells, weigh bridges or a small quadrat, or record total weight of bales from the field. It may be necessary to send off subsamples to measure dry matter percentage.

## livestock forage requirement

Aiming to optimise the amount of meat or milk produced from home-grown forages should help reduce the requirement for purchased concentrates and reduce costs of production. To maximise meat and milk production from grass and forage, efficient production and utilisation is needed. It is important to match supply to demand to avoid oversupply of nutrients to crops and poor utilisation.

## Sampling for soil pH, phosphorus, potassium

## and magnesium

Current phosphate, potash and magnesium recommendations are based on achieving and maintaining target Soil Indices for each nutrient in the soil throughout the crop rotation. Soil analysis should be done every 3–5 years. The use of soil analysis as a basis for making nutrient decisions and the procedure for taking soil samples is described below.

#### Taking soil samples

Soil sampling must be done accurately to avoid misleading results and expensive mistakes. •	The soil in each field should be sampled every 3–5 years (3 years if regularly cut) •	Collect samples at the same point in the rotation and well before growing a sensitive crop, e.g. sugar beet •	For long-term grass, sample between September and February. Sample for short-term (<5 years) leys before sowing or after cultivation. Sample before forage crops (after harvest of the previous crop) •	Do not sample within six months of a lime or fertiliser application (except nitrogen) or six weeks of the last organic manure application in autumn. Avoid sampling when the soil is very dry •	Do not take samples where muck heaps or feeders have been, in headlands, or in the immediate vicinity of hedges, trees or other unusual features •	The soil sample must be representative of the area sampled. Areas of land known to differ in some important respects (e.g. soil type, previous cropping, applications of manure, fertiliser or lime) should be sampled separately. Small areas known to differ from the majority of a field should be excluded from the sample. Avoid sampling visible urine patches or dung pats •	Ideally, the sampled area should be no larger than four hectares •	Clean tools before starting and before sampling a new area •	Walk a ‘W’ pattern across the sampling area, stopping at least 25 times Sampling for soil pH, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium •	At each point, collect a subsample (core) using a gouge corer or screw auger - Sample to 7.5 cm depth in long-term grassland fields - Sample to 15 cm depth in arable fields, short-term (<5 years) leys or grassland about to be ploughed and re-seeded •	The subsamples should be bulked to form a representative sample and sent to the laboratory for analysis •	Use appropriate packaging (normally available from the laboratory) and label samples clearly, providing as much information about the field and crop as possible For soils prone to acidity, more frequent testing may be needed than the 3–5 year cycle used for phosphate, potash and magnesium. Since acidity can occur in patches, spot-testing with a soil indicator test across the field is often useful. Soil indicator tests can also be useful on soils that contain fragments of free lime as these can give a misleadingly high pH when analysed following grinding in the laboratory.

Where there is a known risk of hypomagnesaemia, application of potash in spring should be avoided.In the first season after autumn or spring sowing, deduct the amounts of phosphate and potash applied to the seedbed.

### Point to consider

Phosphate and potash recommendations for legume swards Apply phosphate, potash and magnesium as recommended for pure grass Tables contain the total nutrient required, remember to deduct nutrients swards. Clover may benefit from a small application of potash at Index 2-, applied as organic materials (Section 2: Organic materials). as clover is more responsive to potash than grass. Example 3.2 Phosphate and potash recommendations for a field with one cut of silage and grazing. The field has a P Index of 1 and a K Index of 1. It would require 70 kg of phosphate for the first cut. It would require 30 kg of potash the previous autumn and 80 kg in the spring. There would be a need for additional potash because of a cut being taken. This can be met by applying 30 kg of potash per ha up to twice during the grazing season. If the field was only being grazed, it would require 30 kg of potash, which could be applied in June or July or in several small applications during the season.

#### Sulphur recommendationsNitrogen recommendations

Sulphur is an essential nutrient for maximising dry matter yield protein levels in The nitrogen requirements for grassland can be calculated in four simple steps: both grazed and conserved grass. Sulphur deficiency is common in grassland, especially in later cuts or where high rates of nitrogen are used. Step 1 Select the correct soil nitrogen The symptoms of sulphur deficiency are indicated by a yellowing of the sward. supply (high, moderate or low) In contrast to nitrogen deficiency, in which the older leaves are most affected, Page 12 sulphur deficiency can be identified by yellowing of the youngest leaves. Analysis of uncontaminated herbage sampled just before cutting is a useful indicator of deficiency. The information can be used to assess the need for Step 2 sulphur for future cuts. The critical level is 0.25% total sulphur or an N:S ratio Select the correct grass growth class greater than 13:1. (poor, average, good) Some soils are more at risk of sulphur deficiency than others. Apply sulphur Page 13 as mineral fertiliser or livestock manures, to all grass grown on: •	Sandy and shallow soils, e.g. chalk and limestone •	Loamy and coarse silty soils in areas with >200 mm rainfall Step 3 between November and February Select the target yield •	Clay, fine silty or peat soils in areas with >400 mm rainfall between November and February On soils at risk of sulphur deficiency, apply:

The nutrient recommendations take account of past manure applications Adjusting nitrogen use throughout the season because these influence assessment of the SNS status of a field. The crop Nitrogen requirement and uptake can be heavily influenced by weather available nitrogen supply from manures applied for the current season’s growth conditions, so it is important to continually re-evaluate nitrogen fertiliser (i.e. previous September applications onwards) must be assessed using the requirements throughout the season. information in Section 2: Organic materials and deducted from the •	As nitrogen is more likely to be lost from the soil, aim to target fertiliser recommendation. timing to meet crop nitrogen demand Table 3.6 Determining the soil nitrogen supply status of grassland •	Most nitrogen should be applied in spring or early summer, when sward

Likewise, silage fields that receive regular average applications of manure will usually have a moderate or high SNS status. Fields that are regularly cut for silage and receive little or no manure are likely to have a low SNS status. Adjustments upwards to higher rates of nitrogen may be needed for these fields.

Similarly, grass growth will be restricted when summer rainfall and the moisture Assessing grass growth class stored in the soil (the soil available water) are inadequate to meet the grass Grass growth class (GGC) describes the ability of a site to respond to water demand.

*Approximate application date a. The recommendations take account of nitrogen recycled at grazing. b.  Only applicable to areas with a long grass growing season; the first nitrogen application could be applied as early as mid-to-late January, with the second application in early March. c.  If previous growth has been severely restricted by drought, reduce or omit this application. Applications of N after August are not usually productive because of the supply of nitrogen from soil organic matter at that time. Check nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZ) rules for guidance on timing.

Nitrogen recommendations for grass and clover Generally, little fertiliser nitrogen is needed on swards with an appreciable clover content. On average, a good grass and clover sward (30–40% of dry matter of clover) will give an annual dry matter yield equivalent to that produced from about 180 kg N/ha applied to a pure grass sward. It is often difficult to decide how much nitrogen will be supplied because the clover content can be very changeable from year to year and within a given season. The photographs indicate how to estimate clover content and assess nitrogen supply. These figures should be used as rough guides only because full clover development does not normally take place until late spring onwards. Lucerne and red clover crops have no requirement for N fertiliser, apart from that needed for establishment in low SNS soils (up to 50 kg N/ha). For red clover and grass swards, there may be some advantage in applying a small amount of nitrogen (up to 50 kg N/ha) in the early spring if the grass appears to be nitrogen deficient. Potential nitrogen Percentage cover from cloversupply 180 kg N/ha20–30% cover 240 kg N/ha~40% cover 300 kg N/ha50–60% cover Grazing grass and clover swards Applications of fertiliser nitrogen to grass/clover swards should be made with caution because any form of mineral nitrogen inhibits nitrogen fixation by rhizobia in the clover nodules. There is also a risk of the grass responding to the nitrogen and shading out the clover, which can reduce the percentage of clover in the sward. However, some nitrogen may need to be applied to grass/clover swards to encourage early spring or late autumn growth: •	Apply up to 50 kg N/ha in mid-February to early March if early grass growth is required •	Apply up to 50 kg N/ha in late July or August if autumn grass is required Establishment Clover is particularly sensitive to nitrogen application during establishment. No nitrogen should be used during this period. Cutting grass-clover, red clover or lucerne swards •	Do not apply high levels of nitrogen if a silage crop is taken from a grass/clover sward where the clover content needs to be maintained •	Do not apply any fertiliser nitrogen for red clover or lucerne conservation

### Point to consider

The rate and timing of nitrogen applications in fertiliser and organic materials are subject to limits under regulations. For further information, see box on page 4.

#### Nutrient recommendations for grass establishmentMagnesium, sodium and micronutrient recommendations

Correct nutrition is important to ensure successful establishment of a new Magnesium sward. The phosphate, potash and nitrogen recommendations will differ from Grass swards must contain a sufficiently high level of magnesium if the risk of existing swards. New leys have a greater requirement for phosphate to help hypomagnesaemia (grass staggers) is to be reduced. At soil magnesium Index 0, with root development and a lower requirement for nitrogen. apply 50–100 kg magnesium oxide (MgO) per ha every three or four years. Table 3.11 Phosphate and potash recommendations for grass establishment However, the uptake of herbage magnesium decreases as nitrogen and potash

Nitrogen should not be applied where it will stimulate weed growth (e.g., in weedy stubbles) or seedling competition (e.g., direct-drilled into an existing sward). Be aware of closed periods in regulations (e.g. NVZ). For spring-sown swards, deduct the amount of nitrogen applied for establishment from the first season’s grazing or silage/hay requirement. Grassland recommendations17

<!-- Page 18 -->

Sodium Sodium has no effect on grass growth but a minimum level of 0.15% (dry matter basis) in the diet is essential for livestock health. Research has demonstrated that sodium can improve the palatability of grass and therefore increase dry matter intake. Herbage or forage analysis is useful to assess the sodium status of grass and its balance with potassium. Where sodium levels are low (below 0.15%) or the K:Na ratio is higher than 20:1, mineral supplements may be required for some classes of stock or a sodium-containing fertiliser may be used. Apply sodium in fertiliser at 140 kg/ha NaO in early spring, either in a single  2 or split application, to improve herbage mineral balances. To improve pasture palatability, apply regular dressings of 10 kg/ha NaO throughout the season.2 Herbage or forage analysis can be useful to assess nutrient requirements and balances. •	Magnesium (Mg) deficiency is indicated if the Mg concentration is below 0.20% (dry matter basis) or the K:Mg ratio is above 20:1 •	Sodium (Na) deficiency is indicated if the Na concentration is below 0.15% (dry matter basis) or the K:Na ratio is above 20:1 Herbage or forage analysis is a useful indicator of the need for additional magnesium and for assessing the risk of hypomagnesaemia. Maintain magnesium concentrations above 0.20% (dry matter basis) and ensure the K:Mg ratio does not exceed 20:1. The K:Na and K:Mg ratios are key indicators of the nutritional quality of forage and reducing the risk of tetany. Micronutrients (trace elements) When adding lime, avoid liming fields above pH 7 as this can induce deficiencies of trace elements, such as copper, cobalt and selenium, which can adversely affect livestock growth but not affect grass growth. Too few micronutrients in the overall diet can lead to deficiency in some animals, and cobalt deficiency can affect nitrogen fixation by clover. Aim to only use micronutrient supplementation when a deficiency has been diagnosed. When deficiency does occur, the most effective means of control is usually to treat the animal with the appropriate trace element, although application of cobalt and selenium to grazing pastures can be effective. If deficiencies are identified, consult an accredited feed adviser – preferably one listed in the Feed Adviser Register (FAR) – to decide on an appropriate course of action. More information on the use of lime is given in Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use.

## Forage crop recommendations

#### Calculating soil nitrogen supply (SNS)

Fields vary widely in the amount of nitrogen available to a crop before any fertiliser or manure is applied. This variation must be taken into account to avoid inadequate or excessive applications of nitrogen. The soil nitrogen supply (SNS) system (Index 0 to 6) indicates the likely extent of this ‘background’ SNS. Once the Index is identified, it can be used to select the appropriate nitrogen recommendation to achieve optimum yield. The system used to estimate SNS in cultivated fields is different from the system used in grass fields. The SNS Index for each field used to grow a forage or arable crop can be arrived at either by the: •	Field Assessment Method – an estimation of SNS based on soil type, previous cropping and winter rainfall •	Measurement Method – a soil sample is collected and sent to a laboratory for analysis The Field Assessment Method is most commonly used by livestock farmers and is described in this section. If you wish to use the Measurement Method, it is described in Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use, with further detail provided in Section 4: Arable crops.

### Points to consider

•	The Field Assessment Method does not take account of the nitrogen that will become available to a crop from any organic materials applied since harvest of the previous crop. These should be deducted from the fertiliser nitrogen application rates shown in the recommendation tables. See also Section 2: Organic materials •	The Measurement Method is not suitable for organic and peaty soils because SNS is very unpredictable (because of the mineralisation of soil organic matter) Forage crop recommendations

#### Field Assessment Method

There are five essential steps to follow to identify the appropriate SNS Index: Step 1: Identify the soil category for the field. Step 2: Identify the previous crop. Step 3: Select the rainfall range for the field. Step 4: Identify the provisional SNS Index using the appropriate table. Step 5: Make any necessary adjustments to the SNS Index. Step 1: Identify the soil category for the field Careful identification of the soil category in each field is very important. The whole soil profile should be assessed to a one-metre depth for forage crops. Where the soil varies and nitrogen is to be applied uniformly, select the soil type that occupies the largest part of the field. The soil type can be identified using Figure 3.2, which categorises soils on their ability to supply and retain mineral nitrogen. The initial selection can then be checked using Table 3.13 (page 21). Carefully assess the soil organic matter content when deciding if the soil is organic (10–20% organic matter for the purposes of this guide) or peaty (more than 20% organic matter). If necessary, seek professional advice on soil type assessments, remembering this will only need to be done once.

| Soil category | Description of soil types within category | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light sand soils | Soils that are sand, loamy sand or sandy loam to 40 cm depth and are sand or loamy sand between 40–80 cm, or over sandstone rock. | Soils in this category have poor water-holding capacity and retain little nitrogen. |
| Shallow soils | Soils over impermeable subsoils and those where the parent rock (chalk, limestone or other rock) is within 40 cm of the soil surface. Sandy soils developed over sandstone rock should be regarded as light sand soils. | Soils in this category are less able to retain or supply nitrogen at depth. |
| Medium soils | Mostly medium-textured mineral soils that do not fall into any other soil category. These include sandy loams over clay, deep loams, and silty or clayey topsoils that have sandy or loamy subsoils. | Soils in this category have moderate ability to retain nitrogen and allow average rooting depth. |
| Deep clayey soils | Soils with predominantly sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay topsoil overlying clay subsoil to more than 40 cm depth. Deep clayey soils normally need artificial field drainage. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils. |
| Deep silty soils | Soils of sandy silt loam, silt loam or silty clay loam textures to 100 cm depth or more. Silt soils formed on marine alluvium, warp soils (river alluvium) and brickearth soils are in this category. Silty clays of low fertility should be regarded as other mineral soils. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and allow rooting to greater depth. |
| Organic soils | Soils that are predominantly mineral but with between 10–20% organic matter to depth. These can be distinguished by darker colouring that stains the fingers black or grey. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and have higher nitrogen mineralisation potential. |
| Peat soils | Soils that contain more than 20% organic matter derived from sedge or similar peat material. | Soils in this category have very high nitrogen mineralisation potential. |

The Indices shown in Table 3.18 assume that little or no organic materials have been applied. Where silage fields have received the organic manures produced by livestock that have eaten the silage and the manure has been applied in spring, they should be regarded as containing nitrogen residues equivalent to a previous grazing history. ‘Low N’ grassland means average annual inputs of less than 250 kg N/ha in fertiliser plus crop available nitrogen in organic materials used in the last two years, or swards with little clover. ‘High N’ grassland means average annual applications of more than 250 kg N/ha in the last two years, clover-rich swards or lucerne. Step 5: Make any necessary adjustments to the SNS Index When using the field assessment method, it is not necessary to estimate the amount of nitrogen taken up by the crop over winter. This is already taken into account in the tables. Manure history: Where regular applications of organic manures have been made to previous crops in the rotation, increase the Index value by one or two levels, depending on manure type, application rate and frequency of application. The nitrogen contribution from manures applied after harvest of the previous crop should not be considered when deciding the SNS Index. This contribution should be deducted from the recommended nitrogen application rate using the information in Section 2: Organic materials. Fertiliser residues from the previous crop: The Index assessments assume that the previous crop grew normally and that it received the recommended rate of nitrogen applied as fertiliser and/or organic manures. The Index should be increased if there is reason to believe nitrogen residues are likely to be greater than normal and these residues will not be lost by leaching. This could occur where a cover crop was sown in autumn and grew well over winter. Similarly, the Index may need to be adjusted downwards if there is reason to believe nitrogen residues will be smaller than usual. Example 3.4 Maize is to be sown following overwintered barley stubbles after a long-term arable rotation with limited use of organic manures. The soil is a light sand in a high rainfall area. Using Table 3.17, the SNS Index would be 0. Using Table 3.19, the nitrogen recommendation would be 150 kg N/ha. Forage crop recommendations Example 3.5 Winter wheat is to be sown following a three-year pure grass ley, which has been managed in the last two years using 280 kg N/ha/year as fertiliser plus crop available nitrogen in manure. Slurry has been applied in early spring each year before taking one cut of silage followed by grazing. The soil is a medium soil in a moderate rainfall area. The previous grass management is classed as ‘high N’. Using Table 3.18 for medium soils, select the category ‘3-5 year leys high N, 1 cut and grazed’, which gives an SNS index of 2 in year one. Regular applications of slurry in previous years could increase the SNS Index by one level, but account should be taken of the application rate and N content of the slurry.

#### Phosphate, potash and magnesium recommendations

The results of a recent soil analysis are needed to determine phosphate, potash and magnesium recommendations. The use of soil analysis as a basis for making nutrient decisions is described in Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use. Recommendations are given in the tables as phosphate (P2O5) and potash (K2O). Conversion tables are given on page 33. •	Recommendations at target Indices (2 for phosphate and 2- for potash) are maintenance dressings intended to meet crop requirements and maintain soil reserves to prevent depletion of soil fertility •	Recommendations at Indices lower than target include an allowance for building up soil reserves over several years (typically 10–15 years to raise one Soil Index) as well as meeting immediate crop requirement •	All recommendations are given for the midpoint of each Index (midpoint of 2- for potash). Where the soil analysis value is close to the range of an adjacent Index, the recommendation may be reduced or increased •	Recommendations are based on a typical yield. Adjustments can be made for higher or lower yields by estimating crop offtake using Table 3.2 (page 9)

#### Example 3.6Wholecrop cereals – phosphate, potash, magnesium and sulphur

Wholecrop winter wheat is to be sown on land at P and K Index 0. The crop All wholecrop cereals – phosphate and potashis expected to yield 30 t FW/ha. Table 3.27 Phosphate and potash for all wholecrop cereals Offtake for a wholecrop cereal is 1.8 kg PO/t and 5.4 KO/t (Table 3.2).  252

| Expected yield | Nutrient (kg/ha) | P or K Index |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 30 t FW/ha | Potash | 220 | 190 | 160 | 100 | 0 |

The amounts of phosphate and potash are appropriate to the fresh weight yield shown.  ahdb.org.uk/wheatgg Table 3.2 (page 9) can be used to calculate offtake if wholecrop yields are known to be different, for example a spring-sown crop yielding 25 t FW/ha.AHDB Beef & Lamb Cereals Directory ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/the-cereals-directory-2At Index 2, phosphate and potash can be applied when convenient during the year but, at Index 0 and 1, they should be applied and worked into the seedbed. To avoid damage to germinating seedlings, do not use more than 150 kg/ha of nitrogen plus potash on sandy soils. All wholecrop cereals – magnesium At Mg Index 0, magnesium fertiliser should be applied every 3–4 years at 50–100 kg MgO/ha. All wholecrop cereals – sulphur Not all cereal crops will respond to sulphur. Use Table 3.28 to assess the risk of deficiency. Where deficiency has been recognised or is expected, apply 25–50 kg/ha SO as a sulphate-containing fertiliser in early spring, before  3 the start of stem extension. Table 3.28 Sulphur deficiency risk

Requirements are based on a seed and hay yield of 5 t/ha. If the hay is chopped and returned, much less phosphate and potash is required. Nitrogen Nitrogen rates are for crops for which there is a low risk of crop lodging – either because of field characteristics or where amenity varieties are grown. A lower nitrogen rate will be appropriate for crops with a higher risk of lodging. Higher rates may be needed in the second cropping year or where amenity varieties are grown.Medium soil Depending on the total nitrogen requirement and crop development, it will often be appropriate to apply nitrogen at the following timings: •	Less than 100 kg N/ha: Apply the whole application in early April •	100 kg N/ha or more: Apply 40 kg N/ha in early to mid-March and the balance of the application in early April Where a crop of Italian rye-grass seed is to be grown following a silage crop, apply 60 kg N/ha immediately following the silage crop.

## Analysis of fertilisers and liming materials

The materials listed below are used individually and some are used as components of compound or multi-nutrient fertilisers. The chemical and physical forms of nutrient sources, as well as growing conditions, can influence the effectiveness of fertilisers. A FACTS Qualified Adviser can give advice on appropriate forms for different soil and crop conditions. The reactivity, or fineness of grinding, of liming materials determines their speed of action. However, the amount of lime needed is determined mainly by its neutralising value.

Soil nitrogen supply (SNS) The amount of nitrogen (kg N/ha) in the soil that becomes available for uptake by the crop in the growing season, taking account of nitrogen losses. Soil organic matter Complex, variable fraction of the soil that consists of living, or once-living, materials within, or added to, the soil. These organic compounds, in various stages of breakdown (decomposition), range from undecomposed plant and animal tissues, to fairly stable brown or black material with no trace of the anatomical structure of the material from which it was derived. Soil texture Description based on the proportions of sand, silt and clay in the soil. Soil type Description based on soil texture, depth, chalk content and organic matter content. Target Soil Index Lowest Soil P or K Index at which there is a high probability that crop yield will not be limited by phosphorus or potassium supply. See Soil Index (P, K or Mg). Trace element See Micronutrient. Glossary37
