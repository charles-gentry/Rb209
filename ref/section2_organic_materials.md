## Using the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209)

The Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) is funded and supported by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board in conjunction with a range of industry and academic partners. AHDB first published the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) in May 2017, after taking over secretariat and governance for revisions from Defra in November 2014. Since its publication, recommendations have been revised with the latest independent research funded by AHDB and its partners. A list of updates is available at ahdb.org.uk/rb209 To improve the accessibility and relevance of the recommendations and information, the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) is published as seven sections that are updated individually: •	Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use •	Section 2: Organic materials •	Section 3: Grass and forage crops •	Section 4: Arable crops •	Section 5: Potatoes (content last updated 2021) •	Section 6: Vegetables and bulbs (content last updated 2021) •	Section 7: Fruit, vines and hops (content last updated 2017) This section (Section 2) provides guidance on the use of organic materials. For each material, the content of nitrogen (N), phosphate (P2O5), potash (K2O), 252 magnesium (MgO) and sulphur (SO3) are given in kilograms per tonne (kg/t) or 3 3cubic metre (kg/m).

## Regulation, codes of practice and

## assurance schemes

Organic materials applied to agricultural land, such as livestock manures, biosolids, composts, anaerobic digestates and waste-derived materials, are valuable sources of most major plant nutrients and organic matter. Careful recycling to land allows their nutrient value to be used for the benefit of crops and soil fertility, which can result in large savings in the use of manufactured fertilisers. However, organic materials can present a considerable environmental risk if not handled carefully. Guidance on avoiding pollution, including manure management planning is given in the national Codes of Good Agricultural Practice (COGAP). For all organic materials, it is important to check their use complies with contracts, relevant assurance schemes and animal by-product regulation.

## Sampling livestock manures

For nutrient management planning, it is important to know the nutrient content of manures applied to land. The tables in this section give typical values of the total nutrient content of manures based on the analysis of samples from a wide range of sources. However, the nutrient content of livestock manures is likely to vary significantly, depending on the source and management of the material. For example, the nutrient content will be influenced by farm-specific feeding and bedding practices, and digestate nutrient content will vary on a site-by-site basis depending on feedstock used in the digestion process. The livestock manures produced may have a nutrient content that is consistently different from the values given in the tables. It can, therefore, be worthwhile having the nutrient content of representative manure samples determined by analysis. Rapid on-farm kits (e.g. Agros, Quantofix) can reliably assess the ammonium-N content of liquid manures (e.g. cattle slurries and digestates), but laboratory analysis is necessary for other nutrients. Laboratory analyses should include dry matter (DM), organic matter, total nitrogen (N), total phosphate (P2O5), total potash (K2O), total 252 sulphur (SO3), total magnesium (MgO) and ammonium-N (NH-N).34 Additionally, nitrate-N (NO-N) should be measured in well-composted 3 farmyard manure (FYM) and poultry manures, and uric acid-N in poultry manures. Hydrometers can be used to measure the dry matter content of liquid manures. Where dry matter varies, adjust previous laboratory results or the typical values in the following tables. The nutrient content of liquid manures can vary considerably within a store, due to settlement and crusting. In particular, pig slurry can ‘settle out’ in storage, with a higher dry matter layer being at the base of the store and a lower dry matter layer occupying the mid/upper levels, which, during store emptying, can markedly affect slurry dry matter and associated nutrient contents. Similarly, the composition of solid manure in a heap can vary depending on the amount of bedding and losses of nutrients during storage. If stored materials are to be analysed either in a laboratory or using a rapid on-farm method (e.g. using Agros or Quantofix slurry-N meters), it is important that the sample taken represents an average of what is found in the heap or store. Sampling livestock manures It is important that sampling is carried out carefully and that representative samples are provided for analysis. The optimum sampling frequency will vary depending on how manures are managed on the farm, but at least two samples per year are recommended, coinciding with the main spreading periods.

#### Taking a representative sample of a liquid manure

#### Health & Safety

When sampling enclosed liquid manure stores (pits or tanks), never climb down or lean into the store because of the risk of inhaling toxic gases which can be lethal. •	Collect at least five subsamples of two litres each and pour into a large container •	Thoroughly mix the bulked sample •	On-farm rapid analysis of slurries should be carried out immediately •	If a sample is to be sent to a laboratory, 250 ml should be dispatched in a clean, screw-topped, plastic container (normally available from the laboratory) •	Leave 2–3 cm of airspace to allow the sample to be shaken in the laboratory •	Label the sample clearly, providing as much information as possible •	As soon as possible, send the sample first class to the laboratory (prepaid envelopes are normally available from the laboratory)

<!-- Page 6 -->

Above-ground stores Ideally, the liquid manure should be fully agitated before sampling. If this is not possible and, provided there is safe access from an operator’s platform, the five subsamples can be taken at a range of positions, using a weighted two-litre container attached to a rope. Below-ground pit It may be possible to obtain subsamples at various positions using a weighted container. Earth-banked lagoons Do not attempt to sample direct from the lagoon unless there is a secure operator’s platform that provides safe access. If the slurry has been well agitated, subsamples can be obtained from the slurry tanker or irrigator. If the tanker is fitted with a suitable valve, it may be possible to take five subsamples from this stationary tanker at intervals during filling or while field spreading is in progress. How to sample farmyard manureHow to sample slurry Videos on how to sample farmyard manure and slurry are available at ahdb.org.uk/rb209

#### Taking a representative sample of a solid manure

#### Health & Safety

You should wear rubber gloves and protective clothing when collecting samples. Remember to wash hands and forearms thoroughly after taking samples and before eating or drinking. •	Take at least 10 subsamples of about 1 kg each as described below •	Place on a clean, dry tray or sheet •	Break up any lumps and thoroughly mix the sample •	Take a representative sample of around 500 g for analysis •	Samples should be dispatched in 500-gauge polythene bags (normally available from the laboratory) – expel excess air from the bag before sealing •	Label samples clearly, providing as much information as possible Manure heaps •	Provided the manure is dry and safe to walk on, identify at least 10 locations which appear to be representative of the heap •	After clearing away any weathered material with a spade or fork, either: - Dig a hole approximately 0.5 m deep and take a 1 kg sample from each point - Use a soil auger to obtain subsamples from at least 50 cm into the heap •	Alternatively, take subsamples from the face of the heap at various stages during spreading Weeping-wall stores Do not attempt to take samples before the store is emptied as it is not safe to walk on the surface of the stored material. Subsamples may be taken from the face of the heap once emptying has commenced.

#### Calculations and interpretation of laboratory analysis results

Laboratories differ in the way that the analysis results are expressed and conversion of the results is often needed. Analysis results are variously reported: •	On a dry-weight (DW or 100% DM) or fresh-weight (FW) basis •	In units of grams or milligrams per kilogram (g/kg, mg/kg), grams per 100 grams (g/100 g), per cent (%), grams or milligrams per litre (g/l, mg/l), 3kilograms per tonne (kg/t) or kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m) •	As the nutrient element (N, P, K, Mg, S) or the nutrient oxide (PO, KO, 252 MgO, SO)3 If in doubt about how your results are expressed, as a first step you should confirm with the laboratory. Use the following conversions if analysis results need to be converted. Nutrients To convert nutrient element to nutrient oxide  P    x  2.291  =  P2O5 K    x  1.205  =  K2O Mg    x  1.658  =  MgO S    x  2.5  =  SO3 Solid manures (DM expressed as %) To convert mg/kg nutrient in DM to kg/t FW: mg/kg nutrient  x   % DM 1,000   100 To convert g/kg nutrient in DM to kg/t FW: g/kg nutrient  x   % DM To convert g/100 g nutrient in DM to kg/t FW:  g/100 g nutrient  x   % DM To convert % nutrient in DM to kg/t FW:  % nutrient  x   % DM Sampling livestock manures Solid manures (DM expressed as g/kg) To convert mg/kg nutrient in DM to kg/t FW:  mg/kg nutrient  x  g/kg DM 1,000  1,000 To convert g/kg nutrient in DM to kg/t FW:  g/kg nutrient  x  g/kg DM 1,000 To convert g/100 g nutrient in DM to kg/t FW:  g/100 g nutrient  x  g/kg DM To convert % nutrient in DM to kg/t FW:  % nutrient  x  g/kg DM Liquid manures 3To convert mg/l nutrient to kg/m: mg/l nutrient 1,000 3To convert g/l nutrient to kg/m: g/l nutrient (no change) Example 2.1 Digested sludge cake with 27% DM, and 4.0% N and 3.0% P in DM 4.0%N  x  27% DM  =  10.8 kg N/t in FW 3.0%P  x  27% DM  x   2.29  = 18.6 kg PO/t in FW

## Principles of nitrogen supply and losses

Nitrogen is present in organic materials in two main forms: •	Readily available nitrogen (i.e. ammonium-N as measured by N meters, nitrate-N and uric acid-N) is the nitrogen that is potentially available for rapid crop uptake •	Organic-N is the nitrogen contained in organic forms, which are broken down slowly to become potentially available for crop uptake over a period of months to years Crop-available nitrogen is the readily available N that remains for crop uptake after accounting for any losses of nitrogen. This also includes nitrogen released from organic forms. Following the application of organic materials to land, nitrogen can be lost as follows: •	Ammonium-N can be volatilised to the atmosphere as ammonia gas •	Following the conversion of ammonium-N to nitrate-N, further losses may occur through nitrate leaching and denitrification of nitrate to nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas under warm and wet soil conditions To make best use of their nitrogen content, organic materials should be applied at or before times of maximum crop growth – generally during the late winter to summer period. Use relevant sections of the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) to ensure applications are made at a suitable time for maximum crop growth of the specific crop.

#### Ammonia volatilisation

Typically, around 40% of the readily available nitrogen content of organic materials can be lost following surface application to land. Ammonia loss and odour nuisance can be reduced by ensuring that organic materials are rapidly incorporated into soils (within six hours of application for liquid materials and 24 hours for solid materials to tillage land). For liquid materials, shallow-injection and band-spreading techniques are effective application methods that reduce ammonia emissions (typically by 30–70%), compared with broadcast application. Band-spreading (trailing shoe and trailing hose) and shallow-injection application techniques increase the number of spreading days and cause less sward contamination than surface-broadcast applications. These practices will also increase the amount of nitrogen available for crop uptake. Ammonia losses are generally smaller from low dry matter liquid materials because they more rapidly infiltrate into the soil. Higher dry matter liquid materials remain on the soil/crop surface for longer, leading to greater losses. Losses are also higher when they are applied to dry soils under warm weather conditions.

#### Nitrate leaching

The amount of nitrogen leached following land application is mainly related to the soil type, the application rate, the readily available N content and the amount of rainfall after application. As ammonium-N is rapidly converted in the soil to nitrate-N, organic material applications during the autumn or early-winter period should be avoided, as there is likely to be sufficient overwinter rainfall to wash a large proportion of this nitrate out of the soil before the crop can use it. Delaying applications until late winter or spring will reduce nitrate leaching and increase the efficiency of utilisation of the nitrogen contained. This is particularly important for organic materials with a high content of readily available nitrogen.

#### Release of crop-available nitrogen from organic materials

The organic nitrogen content of organic material is released (mineralised) slowly over a period of months to years. Where the nitrogen mineralised from the material is not taken up by the crop in the season following application, nitrate may be lost by leaching during the following overwinter period. Nitrate may also accumulate in soil organic matter, allowing further long-term savings in nitrogen fertiliser inputs. Around 5% of the total nitrogen content of organic material may become available for the second crop following application.

### Points to consider

•	Statutory rules that affect nutrient use apply in all parts of the UK (see further information on page 4). Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) rules apply in England and Scotland, with similar rules in Wales •	Also in England, Farming Rules for Water cover nutrient use generally but particularly the use of nitrogen and phosphate •	In Northern Ireland, Nutrient Action Programme (NAP) rules affect both nitrogen and phosphate use •	All relevant rules should be consulted at an early stage in nutrient management planning to ensure compliance. There can be closed periods and limitations on the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus applied in manufactured fertilisers and organic manures Principles of nitrogen supply and losses

The availability of manure phosphate to the next crop grown Table 2.1 Sulphur availability from organic materials (typically 50–60%) is lower than from water-soluble phosphate fertilisers.

This will avoid the soil P Index reaching an unnecessarily high level. It is important to manage organic material applications to ensure phosphate and potash are used through the crop rotation.

## Using organic materials and fertilisers together

You should plan to utilise as much as possible of the nutrient content of organic materials. Not adequately allowing for these nutrients, particularly nitrogen, not only wastes money because of unnecessary fertiliser use but also can reduce crop yields and quality, e.g. lodging in cereals, poor fermentation in grass silage and low sugar levels in beet. Step 1: Calculate the quantity of crop-available nutrients supplied by each application of organic material. Step 2: Identify the fields that will benefit most from the application of organic material. This will need to take account of the accessibility and likely soil conditions in individual fields and the application equipment that is available. Crops with a high nitrogen demand should be targeted first. Fields at low soil P or K Indices will benefit more than those at high Indices. Silage fields should be separated in preference to grazing-only fields. Step 3: Plan the application rates for each field, taking into account the phosphate content of organic material over the crop rotation to avoid excessive enrichment of soil phosphorus levels. Make sure that plans adhere to all relevant rules (see box ‘Regulations and guidance for the prevention of water pollution’ on page 4). As far as possible, apply organic materials in the late winter to summer period – this will make the best use of the nitrogen content. Step 4: Aim for the organic material application to supply no more than 50–60% of the total nitrogen requirement of the crop and use manufactured fertiliser to make up the difference. This approach will minimise the potential impact of variations in nitrogen supply from organic materials on crop yields and quality. Step 5: Calculate the nutrient requirement of the crop, then deduct the nutrients supplied from organic materials. This will give the balance that needs to be supplied as manufactured fertiliser. Step 6: Make sure that application equipment is well maintained and suitable for applying the organic material in the most effective way, minimising losses of ammonia-N and soil or crop damage. The equipment should be routinely calibrated for the type of organic material being applied.

#### Practical aspects of organic material use

Organic materials are commonly applied to arable stubbles in the autumn prior to drilling winter cereals. To make the best use of organic material nitrogen and to minimise nitrate leaching losses, materials should, if possible, be applied from late winter to summer. Band spreaders and shallow-injection (5–7 cm deep) equipment allow accurate top-dressing of liquid materials across full tramline widths, without causing crop damage. An additional benefit of these application methods is that odour nuisance and ammonia emissions are reduced by 30–70% compared with conventional ‘splash-plate’ surface application. Herbage contamination is also reduced. Organic material applications before spring-sown crops (e.g. root crops, cereals and oilseed rape) should be made from late winter onwards to minimise nitrate leaching losses, particularly where high readily available nitrogen manures are applied. Under regulations, applications of organic material with a high readily available nitrogen content (e.g. slurry, poultry manure, and digestate) are subject to closed-spreading periods to reduce the risks of nitrate leaching losses. Rapid soil incorporation on tillage land (e.g. within six hours following surface-broadcast application) will minimise ammonia losses and increase crop-available nitrogen supply. Organic material applications to grassland are best made to fields intended for silage or hay production. Cattle slurry and FYM contain large amounts of potash relative to their readily available nitrogen and total phosphate contents and are ideally suited to this situation. However, take care to ensure that the potash supply does not increase the risk of grass staggers (hypomagnesaemia) in stock through reduced herbage magnesium levels. Application rates of solid material should be carefully controlled to avoid the risk of sward damage and contamination of conserved grass, which can adversely affect silage quality. To encourage a low pH and good fermentation, grass cuts following solid material or late slurry applications should be wilted before ensiling, or an effective silage additive used. Where slurry and solid manure applications are made to grazed grassland, the pasture should not be grazed for at least four weeks following application, or until all visible signs of slurry or digestate solids have disappeared. This will minimise the risk of transferring disease to grazing livestock.

N/A = Not applicable a. The nitrogen-availability estimates assume 450 mm of rainfall (after autumn application) and 250 mm (after winter application) up to the end of soil drainage (end of March). Where rainfall differs from these amounts, intermediate values of nitrogen availability should be used. For spring or summer applications, rainfall is not likely to cause movement of agronomically important amounts of nitrogen to below crop rooting depth. b. Sandy/shallow = light sand soils and shallow soils. Medium/heavy = medium, deep fertile silt and deep clay soils (use this category for organic and peaty soils). c. The values assume incorporation by ploughing. Cultivation using discs or tines is less effective in minimising ammonia losses and intermediate values of nitrogen availability should be used. d.  Old FYM = manure which has been stored for three months or more and has an estimated ammonium-N and nitrate-N content of 10% (cattle and sheep FYM) or 15% (pig and duck FYM) of the total nitrogen. e. Fresh FYM = manure which has not been stored prior to land application and has an estimated ammonium-N content of 20% (cattle and sheep FYM) or 25% (pig and duck FYM) of total nitrogen.

#### Understanding the value of livestock manure applications

Example 2.2 330 m/ha of cattle slurry (6% dry matter) is surface-applied in early spring before first-cut silage. The soil is at P Index 2 and K Index 2-. Where the slurry is surface-applied in the spring, the application saves up to £83/ha on manufactured fertiliser costs. This potential saving will be less following autumn or winter application, or where soil P or K Indices are above maintenance levels.

N/A = Not applicable a. The nitrogen-availability estimates assume 450 mm of rainfall (after autumn application) and 250 mm (after winter application) up to the end of soil drainage (end March). Where rainfall differs from these amounts, intermediate values of nitrogen availability should be used. For spring or summer applications, rainfall is not likely to cause movement of agronomically important amounts of nitrogen to below crop rooting depth. b. Sandy/shallow = light sand soils and shallow soils. Medium/heavy = medium, deep fertile silt and deep clay soils (use this category for organic and peaty soils). c. The values assume incorporation by ploughing. Cultivation using discs or tines is likely to be less effective in minimising ammonia losses and intermediate values of nitrogen availability should be used. Biosolids25

#### Understanding the value of biosolids applications

Example 2.4 20 t/ha of digested cake (biosolids) is applied in autumn before oilseed rape (3.5 t/ha seed yield, straw not removed), grown on a medium soil following a previous cereal crop. The digested cake is incorporated by ploughing within 24 hours. The soil is at SNS Index 1, P Index 2 and K Index 2-. Where the digested cake is incorporated in the autumn, the application saves up to £159/ha on manufactured fertiliser costs. This potential saving will be less where soil P or K Indices are above maintenance levels.

#### Understanding the value of compost applications

Example 2.5 30 t/ha of green compost is applied in autumn to a sandy soil before drilling winter barley (8 t/ha grain yield, straw baled). The soil is at P Index 2 and K Index 2-. Allowing for the green compost nutrient supply saves up to £153/ha. This potential saving will be less where soil P or K Indices are above maintenance levels.

## Digestate

Digestate is one of the products of anaerobic digestion, which is the controlled biological decomposition of biodegradable materials such as food wastes, animal manures and crops (e.g. maize and rye) in the absence of oxygen. Digestate is also known as ‘biofertiliser’ if it meets Biofertiliser Certification Scheme standards. Digestate that is certified under the Biofertiliser Certification Scheme and farm-sourced digestate do not normally need an environmental permit or exemption to be in place for application to land. Non-certified digestate from non-agricultural sources is usually applied to land under the Environmental Permitting Regulations. The Biofertiliser Certification Scheme sets baseline quality specifications, set by the British Standards Institution’s Publicly Available Specification 110 (PAS110). While the PAS scheme specifies minimum quality criteria, it also allows customers to specify higher quality thresholds. It is important to check whether customers have any additional quality requirements before digestate is applied.

### Further information

Digestate and compost in agriculture PAS110 wrap.org.uk/resources/guide/compost-and-digestate-agriculture- good-practice-guide Biofertiliser Certification Scheme biofertiliser.org.uk Digestate is normally produced ‘whole’ (a slurry-like material with a dry matter content of around 5%), but this can be separated into fibre and liquid fractions. Typically, whole digestate and digestate liquid contain significantly more nitrogen in the readily available form than cattle slurry. Usually 80–90% of the nitrogen in whole and liquid digestate is in the readily available form and applications would be subject to closed-spreading periods in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones. In separated fibre (typically 25% dry matter), usually less than 30% of the total nitrogen is in the readily available form and applications would not be subject to closed-spreading periods in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, although this should be checked. Separated fibre contains considerably more phosphate than whole and liquid digestate. The nutrient content of the digestate is controlled by the feedstock used in the digestion process. Food-based digestates will typically have much higher nutrient contents than farm-sourced (e.g. crop- and manure-based) digestate. The values in Tables 2.18 and 2.19 are indicative and nutrient contents are likely to vary considerably between sites. PAS110 digestate will have been sampled and analysed regularly during production and should be supplied with specific nutrient content data. It is recommended that application rates of high readily available nitrogen digestates are carefully controlled to reduce the risk of excessive nitrogen applications.

### Points to consider

•	The nutrient content of digestate products will vary depending on the source materials and treatment process •	PAS110 digestate should be supplied with specific nutrient content data and other relevant information
