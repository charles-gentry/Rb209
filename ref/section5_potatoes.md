### Using the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209)

The Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) helps you make the most of organic materials and balance the benefits of fertiliser use against the costs – both economic and environmental. The guide outlines the value of nutrients and soil, and explains why good nutrient management is about more than just fertilisers. It can save you money as well as help protect the environment. AHDB first published the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) in May 2017. Since its publication, recommendations have been revised, with the latest independent research funded by AHDB and its partners. A list of updates is available at ahdb.org.uk/rb209 To improve the accessibility and relevance of the recommendations and information, the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) is published as seven sections that are updated individually.

### Further information

The Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) will be updated regularly. Please email your contact details to comms@ahdb.org.uk so that we can send you notifications of when they are published.

This section provides guidance for potato crops and should be read in conjunction with Sections 1 and 2. For each crop, recommendations for nitrogen (N), phosphate (P2O5) and potash (K2O) are given in kilograms per hectare (kg/ha). Magnesium (MgO) and sulphur (as SO) are given in kg/ha where these nutrients are needed. Recommendations are given for the rate and timing of nutrient application. The recommendations are based on the nutrient requirements of the crop being grown, while making allowance for the nutrients supplied by the soil. When grown in soil with a good structure, potatoes are capable of producing extensive root systems that are efficient in taking up water and nutrients, therefore, every effort should be made to ensure seedbeds are free of compaction. The value of the potato crop is dictated by the marketable yield, not the total yield and, in consequence, decisions about fertiliser rates should be considered together with factors such as site selection and seed rates. Because of the very wide range of varietal characteristics and quality requirements for different market outlets, guidance from a FACTS Qualified Adviser should be used when making decisions for a specific crop.

### Checklist for decision-making

Individual decisions for fertiliser use must be made separately for every field. Where more than one crop is grown in a field, these areas must be considered individually. 1. Confirm the crop to be grown and the intended market. Identify any crop quality criteria required by this market, e.g. dry matter content and skin finish. 2.  Identify the dominant soil type in the cropped area (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use). 3.  Assess soil structure and take action to remove soil compaction, if necessary. Poor soil structure can restrict crop growth and results in poor nutrient and water use efficiency. 4. Carry out soil analysis for pH, P, K and Mg every 3–5 years (page 7). Target values to maintain in arable rotations are: •	Soil pH 6.5 (5.8 on peat soils) •	Soil P Index 2 •	Soil K lower Index 2 (2-) •	Soil Mg Index 2 5.  Identify the Soil Nitrogen Supply (SNS) Index of the field, either by using the Field Assessment Method (page 11) or the Measurement Method (page 18). The Measurement Method is recommended where nitrogen supply from crop residues is expected to be high (SNS of more than 120 kg N/ha for arable rotations), or is uncertain. 6.  Calculate the total and crop-available nutrients from organic materials that have been applied since harvest of the previous crop, or which will be applied to the crop being grown (Section 2: Organic materials).Deduct these nutrients from the recommended rates given in the tables. Checklist for decision-making 7. Also check if the field is within a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) – consider the rules for application rates and timing for fertilisers and organic materials and adjust plans to comply with NVZ requirements. 8.  Decide on the strategy for phosphate and potash use. This will be building up, maintaining or running down the Soil Index (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management). Allow for any surplus or deficit of phosphate or potash applied to previous crops in the rotation. 9.  Calculate the amount of phosphate and potash removed in the harvested crop according to targeted crop yield (page 8). This is the amount of these nutrients that must be replaced in order to maintain the soil at the current Index. 10. Using the tables, decide on the required rate of each nutrient. Decide on the optimum timings for fertiliser application, then find the best match for these applications using available fertilisers. 11. Check that the fertiliser spreader or sprayer is in good working order and has been recently calibrated (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management). 12. Keep an accurate record of the fertilisers and organic manures applied.

Taking soil samples for phosphorus, potassium and magnesiumOn soils where acidity is known to occur, more frequent testing may be needed than the four-year cycle used for phosphate, potash and magnesium. Since Soil sampling must be done well to avoid misleading results and acidity can occur in patches, spot testing with a soil test kit across the field is expensive mistakes. often useful. Soil tests can also be useful on soils which contain fragments of free lime, since these can give a misleadingly high pH when analysed following •	The soil in each field should be sampled every 3–5 years grinding in the laboratory. •	Collect samples at the same point in the rotation and well before growing Classification of soil analysis results into Indicesa sensitive crop e.g. sugar beet •	Ideally, sample immediately after the harvest of the previous cropThe laboratory soil analysis results for P, K and Mg (in mg/kg dry soil) can be converted into Soil Indices using Table 5.1.•	Do not sample within six months of a lime or fertiliser application (except nitrogen) and avoid sampling when the soil is very dryTable 5.1 Classification of soil P, K and Mg analysis results into Indices

Phosphate, potash and magnesium recommendationsThe amounts of phosphate and potash shown in Table 5.2 at Index 2 are those recommended to achieve a total yield of 50 t/ha. Crops grown on soil at Indices The phosphate recommendations are higher than that required to 0 and 1 would be expected to respond to the extra amounts of phosphate, replace offtake and are intended to achieve optimum yield. The potash potash and magnesium shown in Table 5.2. recommendations are required to replace the offtake and maintain target Soil Indices. The larger recommended applications for soils at Index 0 and 1 will There is no need to adjust the recommended phosphate rates if the target yield bring the soil to Index 2 over a number of years. By not applying fertiliser at is higher or lower than 50 t/ha. Index 3 or above, soil will run down over a number of years to the target Index. However, the potash recommendation at target or lower Indices can be adjusted when yield is likely to be larger or smaller than 50 t/ha by multiplying

The amount of phosphate recommended for soils at P Index 2 or 3 is more than sufficient to replace the phosphate removed by a 50 t/ha crop (about 50 kg PO). The surplus phosphate will help to maintain the soil at a target P Index 2 for an arable crop rotation and should be allowed for when assessing the need for phosphate for following crops. On soils at P Index 0 and 1, the surplus phosphate will help increase the soil P Index and no allowance should be made when deciding the phosphate requirement of a subsequent crop. On soils at P Index 2 or below, a large proportion of the phosphate should be water-soluble. The amount of potash recommended at K Index 2 will only replace the amount removed by a 50 t/ha crop and potash should be applied for the next crop in the rotation to maintain the soil at K Index 2. The extra amounts of potash shown for K Index 0 and 1 soils will slowly increase the soil K Index.

#### Timing of application

All the phosphate should be applied in the spring and either worked into the seedbed or placed at planting. Where more than 300 kg KO/ha is required, apply half in late autumn/winter and half in spring. On light sandy soils, all the potash fertiliser should be applied after primary cultivation and no sooner than late winter. Large amounts of potash can sometimes reduce tuber dry matter content. If applicable, reference should be made to recommendations from the processing customer. Where this occurs, the decrease may be smaller when muriate of potash (MOP, potassium chloride) is replaced by sulphate of potash (SOP, potassium sulphate). These recommendations should be used for both bed and ridge and furrow systems. Where fertiliser is placed, a small reduction in the recommended rate of phosphate could be considered.

### Points to consider

•	Ensure the potash offtake is balanced by an application of potash fertiliser on Index 2 soils •	Check the soil is maintained at Index 2 for both phosphate and potash by soil sampling every 3–5 years

P Example 5.2 Soil analysis shows P Index 2 and K Index 2 and main crop potatoes are to be grown. The expected yield is 65 t/ha tubers. Based on 1 t/ha of tubers containing 1 kg PO/ha and 5.8 kg KO/ha, a crop yielding 65 t/ha will remove: Phosphate  65 x 1.0 = 65 kg PO/ha Potash   65 x 5.8 = 377 kg KO/ha However, Table 5.2 recommends 170 kg PO/ha and 300 kg KO/ha for a crop yielding 50 t/ha. For phosphate, the recommendation is much larger than the offtake because potatoes are likely to respond to extra phosphate at P Index 2. Therefore, the phosphate application rate is not adjusted for non-standard yield in potatoes. The surplus phosphate – 105 kg PO/ha (170 - 65 = 105) – should be allowed for when deciding on the phosphate application for the next crop(s) grown in the rotation. For potash, the recommendation should be adjusted for the additional yield expected: 300 + (15 x 5.8) = 387 kg KO/ha. •	Where organic manure is applied, it is important to calculate the quantity of nutrients added in the manure (Section 2: Organic Materials) and adjust the amount of fertiliser accordingly. Allowing for the nutrients in manure reduces the need for fertiliser, improves farm profits and reduces the risk of nutrient pollution of water •	Construct a nutrient balance sheet for each field and ensure the phosphate and potash offtake is balanced by an equivalent application of phosphate and potash on Index 2 soils. Check that the soil is maintained at Index 2 by soil analysis every 3–5 years sphate, potash and magnesium recommendations/Sulphur recommendations

### Sulphur recommendations

Potato crops are not generally thought to be responsive to sulphur. However, atmospheric sulphur emissions have declined significantly and a yield response to sulphur is possible. If deficiency does occur, it is most likely to show first in crops grown on deep sand soils with low organic matter and in areas well away from industrial pollution. Farmers are advised to monitor the sulphur requirements of their crops. Where sulphur deficiency has previously occurred or is expected, apply 25 kg SO/ha as a sulphate-containing fertiliser in the seedbed. Figure 5.3 Sulphur deficiency

### Points to consider

•	Organic materials can supply useful amounts of sulphur (Section 2: Organic materials) •	Sulphur recommendations are given as SO. Conversion tables (metric–imperial, oxide–element) are given on page 25. If applying liquid fertilisers, manufacturers can supply tables which convert kg/ha of nutrient to litres/ha of product •	Further information on the occurrence of sulphur deficiency and diagnostic methods can be found in Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use

<!-- Page 11 -->

### Lime and micronutrient recommendations

Although essential for plant growth, in most cases the very small quantities of micronutrients needed for potatoes can be supplied from soil reserves. The only significant trace element deficiency in potatoes is manganese (Mn), which can occur on peaty, organic or sandy soils at high pH and on other soil types if over-limed. Manganese deficiency usually occurs in patches during periods of rapid growth and can be treated by one or more foliar sprays of a suitable manganese-containing material. Potatoes can tolerate a degree of soil acidity and are best grown at soil pH levels that are lower than for most other arable crops. However, liming immediately before potatoes should be avoided unless the soil pH is very low, as this can increase the risk of common scab and manganese deficiency. Figure 5.4 Manganese deficiency Photograph © Blackthorn Arable Lime and micronutrient recommendations/Calculating Soil Nitrogen Supply

### Calculating Soil Nitrogen Supply (SNS)

Fields vary widely in the amount of nitrogen available to a crop before any fertiliser or manure is applied. This variation must be taken into account to avoid inadequate or excessive applications of nitrogen. The Soil Nitrogen Supply (SNS) system assigns an Index of 0 to 6 to indicate the likely extent of this background nitrogen supply. The Index is used in the recommendation tables to select the amount of nitrogen, as manufactured fertiliser, manure or a combination of both, that typically would need to be applied to ensure optimum yield. The SNS Index for each field can be estimated either by the Field Assessment Method using records of soil type, previous cropping and winter rainfall, or by the Measurement Method. This uses measurements of Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN) plus estimates of nitrogen already in the crop (at the time of soil sampling) and of available nitrogen from the mineralisation of soil organic matter and crop debris during the period of active crop growth.

#### Field Assessment Method

The Field Assessment Method does not take account of the nitrogen that will become available to a crop from any organic manures applied since harvest of the previous crop. The available nitrogen from organic materials applied since harvest of the previous crop, or those that will be applied to the current crop, should be calculated separately using the information in Section 2: Organic Materials and deducted from the fertiliser nitrogen application rates shown in the recommendation tables. There are five essential steps to follow to identify the appropriate SNS Index: Step 1.  Identify the soil category for the field Step 2.  Identify the previous crop Step 3.  Select the rainfall range for the field Step 4.  Identify the provisional SNS Index using the appropriate table Step 5.  Make any necessary adjustments to the SNS Index

<!-- Page 12 -->

Step 1. Identify the soil category for the field Careful identification of the soil category in each field is very important. The whole soil profile should be assessed to one metre depth for arable crops. Where the soil varies, and nitrogen is to be applied uniformly, select the soil type that occupies the largest part of the field. The soil type can be identified using Figure 5.5, which categorises soils on their ability to supply and retain mineral nitrogen. The initial selection can then be checked using Table 5.3. Carefully assess the soil organic matter content when deciding if the soil is organic (10% to 20% organic matter for the purposes of this guide) or peaty (more than 20% organic matter). If necessary, seek professional advice on soil type assessments, remembering this will only need to be done once.

Calculating Soil Nitrogen Supply Table 5.3 Soil category assessment

| Soil category | Description of soil types within category | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light sand soils | Soils that are sand, loamy sand or sandy loam to 40 cm depth and are sand or loamy sand between 40–80 cm, or over sandstone rock. | Soils in this category have poor water-holding capacity and retain little nitrogen. |
| Shallow soils | Soils over impermeable subsoils and those where the parent rock (chalk, limestone or other rock) is within 40 cm of the soil surface. Sandy soils developed over sandstone rock should be regarded as light sand soils. | Soils in this category are less able to retain or supply nitrogen at depth. |
| Medium soils | Mostly medium-textured mineral soils that do not fall into any other soil category. These include sandy loams over clay, deep loams and silty or clayey topsoils that have sandy or loamy subsoils. | Soils in this category have moderate ability to retain nitrogen and allow average rooting depth. |
| Deep clayey soils | Soils with predominantly sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay or clay topsoil overlying clay subsoil to more than 40 cm depth. Deep clayey soils normally need artificial field drainage. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils. |
| Deep silty soils | Soils of sandy silt loam, silt loam or silty clay loam textures to 100 cm depth or more. Silt soils formed on marine alluvium, warp soils (river alluvium) and brickearth soils are in this category. Silty clays of low fertility should be regarded as other mineral soils. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and allow rooting to greater depth. |
| Organic soils | Soils that are predominantly mineral but with between 10–20% organic matter to depth. These can be distinguished by darker colouring that stains the fingers black or grey. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and have higher nitrogen mineralisation potential. |
| Peat soils | Soils that contain more than 20% organic matter derived from sedge or similar peat material. | Soils in this category have very high nitrogen mineralisation potential. |

Step 2. Identify the previous cropMedium residual nitrogen vegetables (‘medium N vegetables’) are crops such as lettuce, leeks and long-season brassicas such as Dutch white cabbage Usually, this is straightforward, but sometimes clarification may be needed: where a moderate amount of crop debris is returned to the soil. High residual nitrogen vegetables (‘high N vegetables’) are leafy, nitrogen- Low residual nitrogen vegetables (‘low N vegetables’) are crops such as rich brassica crops such as calabrese, Brussels sprouts and some crops of carrots, onions, radish, swedes or turnips where the amount of crop residue cauliflower where significant amounts of crop debris are returned to the soil, is relatively small. especially in rotations where an earlier brassica crop has been grown within the previous twelve months. To be available for crop uptake, this organic nitrogen must have had time to mineralise but the nitrate produced must not have been at risk to loss by leaching.

<!-- Page 14 -->

Step 3. Select the rainfall range for the field The appropriate rainfall category should be identified, based on either annual rainfall or excess winter rainfall. Ideally, an estimate of excess winter rainfall is required because this is closely related to drainage by which nitrate will be lost through leaching. Figure 5.6 below shows long-term (1981–2010) average excess winter rainfall and in an average year can be used to select the rainfall category. There are three SNS Index tables representing ‘low rainfall’ (annual rainfall less than 600 mm, or less than 150 mm excess winter rainfall), ‘moderate rainfall’ (between 600–700 mm annual rainfall, or 150–250 mm excess winter rainfall), and ‘high rainfall’ areas (more than 700 mm annual rainfall, more than 250 mm excess winter rainfall). Figure 5.6 Excess winter rainfall (mm) Calculating Soil Nitrogen Supply Step 4. Identify the provisional SNS Index using the appropriate table Tables 5.4 (low rainfall), 5.5 (moderate rainfall) and 5.6 (high rainfall) should be used where the field has not been in grass within the past three years. Select one of these tables according to rainfall for the field. Take account of the footnotes to the tables. Higher than typical Indices can occur where there has been a history of grassland or frequent applications of organic manures. Soil analysis for Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN) is recommended in these situations. If grass has been grown in the previous three years, also look at Table 5.7. Select the higher of the Index levels based on the last crop grown (from Table 5.4, 5.5 or 5.6) and that based on the grass history (Table 5.7).

### Points to consider

•	Do not confuse SNS (Soil Nitrogen Supply) and SMN (Soil Mineral Nitrogen) •	SMN is the measured amount of mineral nitrogen (nitrate-N plus ammonium-N) in the soil profile •	SNS = SMN (0–90 cm or maximum rooting depth in shallow soils over rock) + crop N (at time of sampling for SMN) + estimate of available N from mineralisation of organic matter

The Indices shown in Table 5.7 assume that little or no organic manure has been applied. Where silage fields have received the organic manure produced by livestock that have eaten the silage and the manure has been applied in spring, they should be regarded as containing nitrogen residues equivalent to a previous grazing history. ‘Low N’ grassland means average annual inputs of less than 250 kg N/ha in fertiliser plus crop-available nitrogen in manure used in the last two years, or swards with little clover. ‘High N’ grassland means average annual applications of more than 250 kg N/ha in fertiliser plus crop-available nitrogen in manure used in the last two years, or clover-rich swards or lucerne. Step 5. Make any necessary adjustments to the SNS Index When using the Field Assessment Method, it is not necessary to estimate the amount of nitrogen taken up by the crop over winter. This is already taken into account in the tables. Manure history: Where regular applications of organic manures have been made to previous crops in the rotation, increase the Index value by one or two levels depending on manure type, application rate and frequency of application.

### Point to consider

•	The nitrogen contribution from manures applied after harvest of the previous crop should not be considered when deciding the SNS Index; this contribution should be deducted from the recommended nitrogen application rate using the information in Section 2: Organic Materials Calculating Soil Nitrogen Supply Field vegetables as previous crop: On medium, deep silty or deep clayey soils, nitrogen residues in predominantly vegetable rotations can persist for several years, especially in the drier parts of the country. This is likely to be especially evident following ‘high’ or ‘medium N vegetables’. The SNS tables make some allowance for this long persistency of nitrogen residues, but the Index level may need to be adjusted upwards, particularly where: •	Winter rainfall is low •	The history of vegetable cropping is longer than one year •	Larger than average amounts of crop residue or unused fertiliser are left behind (see footnote to Table 5.4) In rotations where vegetable crops are grown infrequently and where there is uncertainty, soil sampling for SMN may be appropriate. Fertiliser residues from previous crop: The Index assessments assume that the previous crop grew normally and that it received the recommended rate of nitrogen applied as fertiliser and/or organic manures. The Index should be increased if there is reason to believe nitrogen residues are likely to be greater than normal and these residues will not be lost by leaching. This could occur where a cover crop was sown in autumn and grew well over winter. The Index may need to be adjusted downwards if there is reason to believe nitrogen residues are likely to be smaller than usual. After any adjustment, the SNS Index can be used in the recommendation tables.

<!-- Page 18 -->

#### Measurement Method

This method is particularly appropriate where the SNS is likely to be large and uncertain. This includes: •	Fields with a history of organic manure application and vegetable rotations where the timing of residue incorporation can strongly affect Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN) for the following crop •	Fields where long leys or permanent pasture have been recently ploughed out (but not in the first year after ploughing out) •	Fields where there have been problems such as regular lodging of cereals, very high grain protein or nitrogen contents, or previous crop failure (for example, due to drought or disease) •	Fields where there is significant variation in soil texture and/or large amounts of crop residues are incorporated. Nitrogen residues also can be large following outdoor pigs The SNS Index can be identified using the results of direct measurement of SMN to 90 cm depth in spring, 60 cm depth in autumn/early winter, or to maximum rooting depth in shallow soils over rock. An estimate of net mineralisable nitrogen must be added to the SMN result when calculating the SNS. SNS is likely to be low on light sand and shallow soils that have not received regular additions of organic manure or crop residues, particularly in moderate to high rainfall areas. In this scenario, prediction of SNS using the Field Assessment Method is advised. The Measurement Method is not recommended for peat soils, or in the first season after ploughing out long leys or permanent pasture, where net mineralisation can be very large and uncertain and the measured SMN may be a relatively small component of SNS. For these soils, the Field Assessment Method or local experience will be better guides to SNS. Calculating Soil Nitrogen Supply

### Points to consider

•	Do not confuse Soil Nitrogen Supply (SNS) and Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN) •	SMN is the measured amount of mineral nitrogen (nitrate-N plus ammonium-N) in the soil profile •	SNS = a measurement of SMN + an estimate of subsequent N mineralisation The Measurement Method does not take account of the available nitrogen supplied from organic manures applied after the date of soil sampling for SMN. The available nitrogen from manures applied after sampling should be calculated separately using the information in Section 2: Organic Materials and deducted from the nitrogen rate shown in the appropriate recommendation table. The nitrogen contribution from manures applied before sampling for SMN will be largely taken account of in the measured value and should not be calculated separately. When using the Measurement Method, there are three steps to follow: Step 1.  Measure Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN) Step 2.  Make an allowance for net mineralisable nitrogen Step 3.  Identify the Soil Nitrogen Supply (SNS) Index

<!-- Page 19 -->

In detail, these three steps are: Step 1. Measure Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN) Soil sampling must be done well to avoid misleading results and expensive mistakes. Guidance on how to collect an SMN sample •	In most situations, sampling in late winter or early spring before nitrogen fertiliser is applied gives slightly better predictions of SNS than sampling in the autumn because overwinter leaching is accounted for, especially in high rainfall areas or on shallow or light sand soils. On soils less prone to leaching, sampling in autumn or early spring is equally effective •	Avoid sampling within two to three months of applying nitrogen fertiliser or organic manures, or within a month after sowing •	Areas of land known to differ in some important respects (e.g. soil type, previous cropping, application of manures or nitrogen fertiliser) should be sampled separately •	Do not sample unrepresentative areas, such as ex-manure heaps or headlands •	Avoid collecting and sending samples immediately before the weekend or a public holiday •	Samples must be taken to be representative of the area sampled. A minimum of 10–15 soil cores should be taken following a ‘W’ pattern across each field/area to be sampled •	In larger fields (10–20 ha), increase the number of cores to 15–20, unless the soil type is not uniform, in which case more than one sample should be taken. This can be done by dividing the field into smaller blocks from each of which 10–15 soil cores are taken •	Each position should be sampled at three depths in the spring: 0–30 cm, 30–60 cm and 60–90 cm. Sampling to 60 cm is adequate in the autumn Calculating Soil Nitrogen Supply •	Samples from each depth should be bulked to form a representative sample of that depth. If the bulk sample is too big, take a representative subsample to send to the laboratory; do not stir the sample excessively •	Use appropriate packaging (normally available from the laboratory) and label samples clearly, providing as much information about the field and crop as possible •	Samples should be analysed within three days of sampling; samples must be kept cool (2–4˚C) but not frozen during storage or transport It is important to avoid cross-contamination of samples from different depths. Using a mechanised one-metre-long gouge auger (2.5 cm diameter) is a satisfactory and efficient method, but care must be taken to avoid excessive soil compaction and contamination between soil layers. If each depth layer is to be sampled individually by hand, a series of screw or gouge augers should be used where the auger diameter becomes progressively narrower as the sampling depth increases. Analysis in the laboratory Samples should be analysed for nitrate-N and ammonium-N. Analytical results in mg N/kg should be converted to kg/ha, taking into account the dry bulk density of the soil, then summed to give a value for the whole soil profile. For the majority of mineral soils, a ‘standard’ bulk density of 1.33 g/ml can be used and the calculation can be simplified to: SMN (kg N/ha) = mg N/kg x 2 (for each 15 cm layer of soil) SMN (kg N/ha) = mg N/kg x 4 (for each 30 cm layer of soil) SMN (kg N/ha) = mg N/kg x 8 (for each 60 cm layer of soil)

It may be best for changes in nitrogen use to be introduced gradually over a few seasons so that the effect on crop performance can be monitored.

Timing of nitrogen application If top dressing is planned for management reasons or to reduce the risk of leaching for crops grown on light sand and shallow soils, apply about two- thirds of the nitrogen recommendation in the seedbed and the remainder shortly after emergence. Aim to apply all the nitrogen by the time of tuber initiation (about three weeks after 50% plant emergence). For other crops, apply all of the recommended nitrogen in the seedbed. The effect of irrigation Differences in the nitrogen requirement of irrigated or rain-fed crops are generally small. However, nitrogen rates could be reduced by 15–20 kg N/ha in rain-fed, determinate crops in order to achieve the same yield.

### Further information

Information on seasonal water management for potatoes ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/seasonal-water-management- for-potatoes Placement of nitrogen in bed systems The same recommendations should be used for bed as well as ridge and furrow systems. Where fertiliser application methods reduce the amount of nitrogen falling into furrow bottoms (e.g. placement or banded applications), reductions in the total amount of nitrogen applied could be considered. Problems with previous potato crops If similar crops grown in previous seasons have had problems with excessive canopy production and were defoliated at complete ground cover, consider reducing the nitrogen application rate. Similarly, if there have been frequent problems with delayed skin-set, consider reducing the nitrogen rate towards the lower end of the recommended range. Nitrogen recommendations Allowances should be made for the likely supply of nitrogen from incorporated cover crop residues. However, growers will need guidance on how to assess the amount of N taken up by the cover crop and what proportion is likely to be made available. Growers should refer to Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use for further information.

### Points to consider

•	Excess (or ‘insurance’) applications of nitrogen can: •	Decrease yield, especially in shorter-season indeterminate varieties •	Increase haulm size, prevent effective penetration of fungicidal sprays, delay natural senescence and create difficulties with desiccation •	Delay achievement of skin set •	Sometimes affect achievement of target dry matter concentrations

#### Selecting the most appropriate fertiliser

For a single nutrient, the recommended amount can be applied using a straight fertiliser. Where more than one nutrient is required, a compound or blended fertiliser can be used. In this case, the compound or blend selected will depend on the ratio of the nutrients in the fertiliser; the amount applied should give as near the recommended amount of each nutrient as possible. Often, it will not be possible to match exactly the recommendations with available fertilisers. In most cases, the first priority is to get the amount of nitrogen correct because crops respond most to nitrogen. Slight variations in the rates of phosphate or potash will have less effect on yield, especially on Index 2 soils, and any discrepancy can be corrected in fertiliser applications to future crops. The approximate nutrient content of commonly used fertilisers is described on page 26..

### Analysis of fertilisers and liming materials

The materials listed below are used individually and some are used as components of compound or multi-nutrient fertilisers. The chemical and physical forms of nutrient sources, as well as growing conditions, can influence the effectiveness of fertilisers. A FACTS Qualified Adviser can give advice on appropriate forms for different soil and crop conditions. The reactivity, or fineness of grinding, of liming materials determines their speed of action. However, the amount of lime needed is determined mainly by its neutralising value.

Glossary Soil Index   Concentration of available P, K or Mg, as determined (P, K or Mg)  by standard analytical methods, expressed in bands or Indices. Soil Mineral Ammonium and nitrate nitrogen measured by the Nitrogen (SMN)  standard analytical method and expressed in kg N/ha. Soil Nitrogen The amount of nitrogen, (kg N/ha) in the soil that Supply (SNS)  becomes available for uptake by the crop in the growing season, taking account of nitrogen losses. Soil organic matter  Often referred to as humus. Composed of organic compounds ranging from undecomposed plant and animal tissues to fairly stable brown or black material with no trace of the anatomical structure of the material from which it was derived. Soil texture  Description based on the proportions of sand, silt and clay in the soil. Target soil Index  Lowest soil P or K Index at which there is a high probability crop yield will not be limited by phosphorus or potassium supply. See Soil Index (P, K or Mg).
