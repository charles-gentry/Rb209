### Using the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209)

The Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) helps you make the most of organic materials and balance the benefits of fertiliser use against the costs – both economic and environmental. The guide outlines the value of nutrients and soil, and explains why good nutrient management is about more than just fertilisers. It can save you money as well as help protect the environment. AHDB first published the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) in May 2017. Since its publication, recommendations have been revised, with the latest independent research funded by AHDB and its partners. A list of updates is available at ahdb.org.uk/rb209 To improve the accessibility and relevance of the recommendations and information, the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) is published as seven sections that are updated individually.

### Further information

The Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) will be updated regularly. Please email your contact details to comms@ahdb.org.uk so that we can send you notifications of when they are published.

This section provides guidance for vegetables and bulbs, and should be read in conjunction with Sections 1 and 2. For each crop, recommendations for nitrogen (N), phosphate (P2O5) and potash (K2O) are given in kilograms per hectare (kg/ha). Magnesium (MgO), sulphur (as SO) and sodium (NaO) recommendations, also in kg/ha, are given where these nutrients are needed. Recommendations are given for the rate and timing of nutrient application. These are based on the nutrient requirements of the crop being grown, while making allowance for the nutrients supplied by the soil.

### Checklist for decision-making

Decisions for fertiliser use must be made separately for each field. Where more than one crop is grown in a field, crops must be considered individually. 1. Confirm the crop to be grown and the intended market. Identify any specific crop quality requirements for this market. 2. Identify the dominant soil type in the cropped area (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use). 3. Assess soil structure and take action to remove soil compaction and improve drainage, if necessary. Poor soil structure can restrict crop growth and results in poor nutrient use efficiency. 4. Carry out soil analysis for pH, P, K and Mg every 3–5 years (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use). Target values for vegetable rotations are: •	Soil pH 6.5 or 7.0 for brassicas if clubroot is a problem (pH 5.8 on peat soils) •	Soil P Index 3 •	Soil K Index 2+ •	Soil Mg Index 2

Identify the Soil Nitrogen Supply (SNS) Index of the field either by using the Field Assessment Method (page 7) or the Measurement Method (page 14). 6. Calculate the nutrients that will be supplied from organic materials that have been applied since harvest of the previous crop (Section 2: Organic materials). Deduct these nutrients from the recommended rates given in the tables. Crop assurance schemes and protocols may restrict application of organic materials. 7. Decide on the strategy for phosphate and potash use. This will be either building up, maintaining or running down the Soil Index levels (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use). Allow for any surplus or deficit of phosphate or potash applied to previous crops in the rotation. 8. Calculate the amount of phosphate and potash removed in the harvested crop (Table 6.8). This is the amount of these nutrients that must be replaced in order to maintain the soil at the target Index. 9. Decide if starter or banded fertiliser would be appropriate. 10. Using the tables, decide on the required rate of each nutrient. Decide on the optimum timings for fertiliser application; then find the best match for these applications using available fertilisers. 11. Check that the fertiliser spreader or sprayer is in good working order and has been recently calibrated (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use). 12. Keep an accurate record of all fertilisers and organic materials applied.

### Crop nitrogen requirement

The nitrogen recommendations for vegetables are based on the following: 1.  Size of the crop – the size, frame or weight of the crop needed to produce optimal economic yields. 2.  Nitrogen uptake – the optimum nitrogen uptake associated with a crop of that size. 3.  Supply of nitrogen – based on the nitrogen supply from the soil within rooting depth, including any nitrogen mineralised from organic matter during the growing season. Recommendations in the tables in this section are given for typical crops produced in the main part of the growing season. Crops planted earlier may need extra nitrogen because the supply of nitrogen from mineralisation is less than later in the growing season. Some vegetables, such as beetroot, can have wide-ranging yield potential, depending on the market. The baby beet crop will have a smaller nitrogen demand but is shallow-rooted so will require similar amounts of nitrogen to higher-yielding processing crops. The recommendations assume effective pest and disease control and that crops are grown on soils in good structural condition. Where crops are grown with minimal control measures or the crop is intended for storage, smaller amounts of nitrogen fertiliser should be considered. In all cases, too much nitrogen fertiliser can give rise to poor-quality crops, especially when growing conditions are difficult. Where large amounts of nitrogen residues from previous crops are expected, measurement of Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN) can be helpful. Crop nitrogen requirement/Calculating Soil Nitrogen Supply Fields vary widely in the amount of nitrogen available to a crop before any fertiliser or manure is applied. This variation must be taken into account to avoid inadequate or excessive applications of nitrogen. The Soil Nitrogen Supply (SNS) system assigns an Index of 0 to 6 to indicate the likely extent of this background nitrogen supply. The Index is used in the recommendation tables to indicate the amount of nitrogen, as manufactured fertiliser, manure or a combination of both, that would typically need to be applied to ensure optimum yield. The SNS Index for each field can be determined either by the Field Assessment Method using records of soil type, previous cropping and excess winter rainfall, or by the Measurement Method using measurements of Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN).

### Further information

Soil Nitrogen Supply for field vegetables ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/soil-nitrogen-supply-for-field-vegetables The Field Assessment Method is suited for predicting SNS in the spring after autumn-harvested crops where SMN is expected to be low (<120 kg N/ha) but is less useful in complex horticultural rotations, particularly where there are repeated crops in the same season. Consider sampling SMN in fields with high or uncertain amounts of residues, such as intensively cropped brassica rotations, or in fields where there is a past history of grass or regular inputs of organic manures. Where there are repeated crops in the same season (i.e. multiple salad crops), the Measurement Method is recommended to determine the SNS Index of the second and third crops. The Measurement Method is also recommended where planting or sowing is late, as Soil Mineral Nitrogen may be higher than expected due to mineralisation.

<!-- Page 7 -->

#### Field Assessment Method

The Field Assessment Method does not take account of the nitrogen that will become available to a crop from any organic manures applied since harvest of the previous crop. The available nitrogen from manures applied since harvest of the previous crop, or those that will be applied to the current crop should be calculated separately using the information in Section 2: Organic materials and deducted from the fertiliser nitrogen application rates shown in the recommendation tables. There are five essential steps to follow to identify the appropriate SNS Index: Step 1. Identify the soil category for the field. Step 2. Identify the previous crop. Step 3. Select the rainfall range for the field. Step 4. Identify the provisional SNS Index using the appropriate table. Step 5. Make any necessary adjustments to the SNS Index. In detail, these steps are: Step 1. Identify the soil category for the field Careful identification of the soil category in each field is very important. The whole soil profile should be assessed to at least rooting depth. Where the soil varies, and nitrogen is to be applied uniformly, select the soil type that occupies the largest part of the field. The soil type can be identified using Figure 6.1, which categorises soils on their ability to supply and retain mineral nitrogen. The initial selection can then be checked using Table 6.1. Carefully assess the soil organic matter content when deciding if the soil is organic (10% to 20% organic matter for the purposes of this guide) or peaty (more than 20% organic matter). If necessary, seek professional advice on soil type assessments, remembering this will need to be done only once. Is soil mainly peat?Peaty soilYES NO Is soil dark and stains fingers black or grey?Organic soilYES NO Is soil over chalk, limestone or other rock (excluding Shallow soilYESsandstone) which is within 40 cm of the soil surface?

Table 6.1 Soil category assessment

| Soil category | Description of soil types within category | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light sand soils | Soils that are sand, loamy sand or sandy loam to 40 cm depth and are sand or loamy sand between 40–80 cm, or over sandstone rock. | Soils in this category have poor water-holding capacity and retain little nitrogen. |
| Shallow soils | Soils over impermeable subsoils and those where the parent rock (chalk, limestone or other rock) is within 40 cm of the soil surface. Sandy soils developed over sandstone rock should be regarded as light sand soils. | Soils in this category are less able to retain or supply nitrogen at depth. |
| Medium soils | Mostly medium-textured mineral soils that do not fall into any other soil category. These include sandy loams over clay deep loams and silty or clayey topsoils that have sandy or loamy subsoils. | Soils in this category have moderate ability to retain nitrogen and allow average rooting depth. |
| Deep clayey soils | Soils with predominantly sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay or clay topsoil overlying clay subsoil to more than 40 cm depth. Deep clayey soils normally need artificial field drainage. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils. |
| Deep silt soils | Soils of sandy silt loam, silt loam or silt clay loam textures to 100 cm depth or more. Silt soils formed on marine alluvium, warp soils (river alluvium) and brickearth soils are in this category. Silt clays of low fertility should be regarded as other mineral soils. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and allow rooting to greater depth. |
| Organic soils | Soils that are predominantly mineral but with between 10–20% organic matter to depth. These can be distinguished by darker colouring that stains the fingers black or grey. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and have higher nitrogen mineralisation potential. |
| Peat soils | Soils that contain more than 20% organic matter derived from sedge or similar peat material. | Soils in this category have very high nitrogen mineralisation potential. |

Step 2. Identify the previous cropare returned to the soil, especially in rotations where an earlier brassica crop has been grown within the previous 12 months. To be available for crop uptake, In vegetable rotations, the type and management of crop residues has this organic nitrogen must have had time to mineralise but the nitrate produced a large influence on the SNS Index. There are three categories of vegetable must not have been at risk to loss by leaching.crop residues – low, medium and high. High residual nitrogen vegetables (‘high N vegetables’) are leafy, nitrogen-rich brassica crops such as calabrese, Brussels sprouts and some crops of cauliflower, where significant amounts of crop debris

<!-- Page 9 -->

Medium residual nitrogen vegetables (‘medium N vegetables’) are crops such as lettuce, leeks and long-season brassicas such as Dutch white cabbage where a moderate amount of crop debris is returned to the soil. Low residual nitrogen vegetables (‘low N vegetables’) are crops such as carrots, onions, radish, swedes or turnips where the amount of crop residue is relatively small. Step 3. Select the rainfall range for the field The appropriate rainfall category should be identified, based on either annual rainfall or excess winter rainfall. Ideally, an estimate of excess winter rainfall is required because this is closely related to drainage by which nitrate will be lost through leaching. Figure 6.2 shows long-term (1981–2010) average excess winter rainfall, which, in an average year, can be used to select the rainfall category. There are three SNS Index tables representing ‘low rainfall’ (annual rainfall less than 600 mm, or less than 150 mm excess winter rainfall), ‘moderate rainfall’ (between 600–700 mm annual rainfall, or 150–250 mm excess winter rainfall) and ‘high rainfall’ areas (over 700 mm annual rainfall, Figure 6.2 Excess winter rainfall (mm)over 250 mm excess winter rainfall). Step 4. Identify the provisional SNS Index Tables 6.2 (low rainfall), 6.3 (moderate rainfall) and 6.4 (high rainfall) should be used where the field has not been in grass within the past three years. Take account of the footnotes to the tables. For organic soils, the SNS is likely to vary widely, typically between Index 3 and 6. Assessments of SNS on these soils should take into account previous experience of crop response to nitrogen. For peats and peaty soils, the SNS is expected to be at Index 5 or 6, irrespective of previous cropping, manuring or excess winter rainfall. However, local experience should be used to judge the nitrogen supply from these soils, particularly when growing shallow-rooted vegetables. Higher than typical Indices can also occur where there has been a history of grassland or frequent applications of organic materials. Soil analysis for Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN) is recommended in these situations. If grass has been grown in the previous three years, also look at Table 6.5. Select the higher of the Index levels based on the last crop grown (Table 6.2, 6.3, 6.4) and that based on the grass history (Table 6.5).

The Indices shown in Table 6.5 assume that little or no organic manure has been applied. Where silage fields have received the organic manures produced by livestock that have eaten the silage and the manure has been applied in spring, such fields should be regarded as containing nitrogen residues equivalent to a previous grazing history. ‘Low N’ grassland means average annual inputs of less than 250 kg N/ha in fertiliser plus crop-available nitrogen in manure used in the last two years, or swards with little clover. ‘High N’ grassland means average annual applications of more than 250 kg N/ha in fertiliser plus crop-available nitrogen in manure used in the last two years, or clover-rich swards or lucerne. Step 5. Make any necessary adjustments to the SNS Index On medium, deep silty or deep clayey soils, nitrogen residues in predominantly vegetable rotations can persist for several years, especially in the drier parts of the country. This is likely to be especially evident following ‘high’ or ‘medium’ N vegetables. The SNS tables make some allowance for this long persistency of nitrogen residues, but the Index level may need to be adjusted upwards, particularly where winter rainfall is low, where the history of vegetable cropping is longer than one year, and in circumstances where larger than average amounts of crop residue or unused fertiliser are left behind (see footnote to Table 6.2). In rotations where vegetable crops are grown infrequently in essentially arable rotations, the Index level may need to be adjusted downwards. Nitrogen-rich leafy residues from many brassica crops are ploughed into the land at various times of the year. The nitrogen in these materials can become available for use by the next crop very rapidly in summer but more slowly in the winter when the soil temperature is lower. In this situation where double-cropping is practised in the summer season, the SNS Index can be increased by 1 if following ‘medium N vegetables’ and by up to 2 following ‘high N vegetables’. It is important that the growing conditions of the first crop are fully taken into account, especially where nitrogen may be leached from light sand soils in wet seasons or where excess irrigation has been applied. Care needs to be taken where residues are ploughed in after late December; the nitrogen may not become available for uptake by the next crop until after that crop requires the bulk of its nitrogen supply. Manure history: Where regular applications of organic manures have been made to previous crops in the rotation, increase the Index value by one or two levels depending on manure type, application rate and frequency of application. Fertiliser residues from previous crop: Nitrogen fertilisation and management of the previous vegetable crop can also have a large impact on SNS. The Index assessments assume that the previous crop grew normally and that it received the recommended rate of nitrogen applied as fertiliser and/or organic manures. Where nitrogen fertiliser recovery of the previous crop is expected to be higher or lower than normal, the SNS Index may need to be adjusted to account for greater or smaller than normal nitrogen residues remaining in the soil. Where there is uncertainty about the amount of nitrogen in the soil, sampling for Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN) may be appropriate.

<!-- Page 13 -->

#### Measurement Method

Direct measurement of SMN provides a more reliable basis for nitrogen decisions in a number of situations. This method is particularly appropriate where the SNS is likely to be large (>120 kg/ha) or uncertain. This includes fields in intensively cropped brassica rotations or fields receiving regular inputs of organic manures or where there is history of grass (but SMN sampling is not recommended during the first year after ploughing out grass). Where there are repeated crops in the same season (i.e. multiple salad crops), the Measurement Method is recommended to determine the SNS Index of the second and third crops. The Measurement Method is also recommended where planting or sowing is late as Soil Mineral Nitrogen may be higher than expected due to mineralisation. For field vegetable crops, it is important to ensure that nitrogen is available to rooting depth, especially with young or shallow-rooted crops, and SMN sampling is also useful to show the availability of SMN within the rooting depth of the crop. SNS is likely to be low on light sand and shallow soils that have not received regular additions of organic manure or crop residues, particularly in moderate to high rainfall areas; under these circumstances, prediction of SNS using the Field Assessment Method is advised. The Field Assessment Method is also recommended on peaty soils or in the first season after ploughing out long leys or permanent pasture. In these situations, nitrogen released by mineralisation of soil organic matter is a large component of the SNS and the Field Assessment Method or local experience will be a better guide to SNS. The SNS Index can be identified using the results of direct measurement of SMN (nitrate-N plus ammonium-N) to rooting depth. For field vegetables, SNS is equivalent to measured SMN; as SMN samples are taken before planting, there is no need to make allowances for crop nitrogen content, and there is also no need to add an estimate of nitrogen mineralisation during the growing season as nitrogen from mineralisation is already taken into account in the recommendation tables. The Measurement Method does not take account of the available nitrogen supplied from organic manures applied after the date of soil sampling for SMN. The available nitrogen from manures applied after sampling should be calculated separately using the information in Section 2: Organic materials and deducted from the nitrogen rate shown in the appropriate recommendation table. The nitrogen contribution from manures applied before sampling for SMN will be largely taken account of in the measured value and should not be calculated separately. When using the Measurement Method, there are two steps to follow: Step 1. Measure Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN). Step 2. Identify the Soil Nitrogen Supply (SNS) Index.

<!-- Page 14 -->

In detail these two steps are: Step 1. Measure Soil Mineral Nitrogen (SMN) Soil sampling must be done well to avoid misleading results and expensive mistakes. Guidance on how to collect an SMN sample •	SMN samples should be collected as close to planting as possible, and not within two months of applying nitrogen fertiliser or organic materials •	Areas of land known to differ in some important respects (e.g. soil type, previous cropping, application of manures or nitrogen fertiliser) should be sampled separately •	Do not sample unrepresentative areas, such as ex-manure heaps or headlands •	Avoid collecting and sending samples immediately before the weekend or a public holiday •	Samples must be taken to be representative of the area sampled. A minimum of 10–15 soil cores should be taken following a ‘W’ pattern across each field/area to be sampled •	In larger fields (10–20 ha), increase the number of cores to 15–20, unless the soil type is not uniform, in which case more than one sample should be taken. This can be done by dividing the field into smaller blocks from each of which 10–15 soil cores are taken •	Take samples in 30 cm sections to 90 cm (0–30 cm, 30–60 cm and 60–90 cm) or to rooting depth. Table 6.6 includes typical rooting depths for field vegetable crops; sampling the soil to 90 cm depth is difficult to do manually •	Samples from each depth should be bulked to form a representative sample of that depth. If the bulk sample is too big, take a representative subsample to send to the laboratory; do not stir the sample excessively •	Use appropriate packaging (normally available from the laboratory) and label samples clearly, providing as much information about the field and crop as possible •	Samples should be analysed within three days of sampling. Samples must be kept cool (2–4˚C) but not frozen during storage or transport It is important to avoid cross-contamination of samples from different depths. Using a mechanised one-metre-long gouge auger (2.5 cm diameter) is a satisfactory and efficient method, but care must be taken to avoid excessive soil compaction and contamination between soil layers. If each depth layer is to be sampled individually by hand, a series of screw or gouge augers should be used where the auger diameter becomes progressively narrower as the sampling depth increases. Analysis in the laboratory Samples should be analysed for nitrate-N and ammonium-N. Analytical results in mg N/kg should be converted to kg/ha, taking into account the dry bulk density of the soil, then summed to give a value for the whole soil profile. For the majority of mineral soils, a ‘standard’ bulk density of 1.33 g/ml can be used and the calculation can be simplified to: SMN (kg N/ha) = mg N/kg x 2 (for each 15 cm layer of soil) SMN (kg N/ha) = mg N/kg x 4 (for each 30 cm layer of soil) SMN (kg N/ha) = mg N/kg x 8 (for each 60 cm layer of soil)

Step 2. Identify the SNS Index Example 6.3 Table 6.6 SNS Indices based on sampling (N kg/ha) to 30, 60 and 90 cm depth Sweetcorn is grown on a light sand soil following courgettes. Annual rainfall

|  | SNS Index |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|  | kg N/ha |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| SMN kg/ha to 30 cm | <20 | 20–27 | 28–33 | 34–40 | 41–53 | 54–80 | >80 |
| SMN kg/ha to 60 cm | <40 | 41–53 | 54–67 | 68–80 | 81–107 | 108–160 | >160 |
| SMN kg/ha to 90 cm | <60 | 61–80 | 81–100 | 101–120 | 121–160 | 161–240 | >240 |

Where SMN is measured to a different depth (i.e. 45 cm), the SNS Index  application provides 50 kg N/ha of crop-available nitrogen that is equivalent should be determined by assuming a uniform concentration of mineral  to inorganic nitrogen fertiliser (Section 2: Organic materials). nitrogen in the soil. Crop nitrogen recommendation of 220 kg N/ha minus 50 kg N/ha crop-available nitrogen supply from digestate = 170 kg N/ha as fertiliser Example 6.1 should be applied. If SMN measured to 45 cm is 54 kg N/ha, then assuming a uniform concentration of nitrogen in the soil, SMN to 60 cm would be 54 kg N/ha x (60 cm/45 cm) = 72 kg N/ha to 60 cm, equivalent to SNS Index 3. Example 6.2 Brussels sprouts are to be grown on a deep silt soil following winter wheat. Annual rainfall is 650 mm. Select Table 6.3 (SNS Indices for moderate rainfall areas). On a deep silt soil following cereals, the SNS Index is 1. Refer to the Brussels sprouts recommendation in Table 6.12 which gives a recommendation of 300 kg N/ha.

<!-- Page 16 -->

Calcul Example 6.4 Two crops of baby leaf lettuce are grown on a deep silt soil after cereals. Annual rainfall is 550 mm. The Field Assessment Method is used to determine SNS for the first crop sown in March. Select Table 6.2 (SNS Indices for low rainfall areas). On deep silt soils after cereals, the SNS Index is 2. Refer to the baby leaf lettuce recommendation in Table 6.19 which gives a recommendation of 40 kg/ha N. The Measurement Method is used to determine SNS for the second crop. The soil is sampled to rooting depth (0–30 cm) in July, prior to planting the second crop. The analysis report shows that the SMN (0–30 cm) is 62 kg N/ha, which is SNS Index 5. The nitrogen recommendation for baby leaf lettuce at Index 5 is 0. No fertiliser nitrogen should be applied to the second crop.

### Phosphate, potash and magnesium recommendations

Many vegetables respond to fresh applications of phosphate and potash fertiliser, especially at low Soil Indices and it is important that these needs are fully met. The target Soil Indices for vegetable rotations are P Index 3 and K Index 2+. The phosphate and potash recommendations given in the tables are sufficient to replace crop offtake at the target Soil Index and therefore to maintain the target Soil Index. The amount of phosphate and potash needed to supply maintenance needs will depend on crop yields and nutrient offtake. For a more precise calculation of maintenance requirements, use Table 6.8 which contains information on phosphate and potash in crop material. Where the soil is below the target phosphate or potash Index, the recommendations given in the tables are higher to allow the soil to ‘build up’ to the target Index over time. g Soil Nitrogen Supply/Phosphate, potash and magnesium recommendations There are instances where small amounts of nitrogen and phosphate fertiliser placed beneath seedlings or transplants can improve establishment, early growth and subsequent use of nutrients. The use of these techniques is encouraged, but the amount in any starter dose applied should be deducted from the total application required. Some vegetable crops are susceptible to magnesium deficiency and may show yield responses to magnesium fertiliser on soils at Mg Index 0 and 1. Magnesium recommendations for all field vegetable crops are for 150 kg MgO/ha at Index 0 and 100 kg MgO/ha at Index 1.

### Points to consider

•	Recommendations assume good soil structure, water supply and pest and disease control •	Recommendations are given as phosphate (P2O5), potash (K2O) and magnesium oxide (MgO). Conversion tables (metric–imperial, oxide–element) are given on page 43 •	Don’t forget to make allowance for the phosphate and potash applied in organic materials (Section 2: Organic materials) •	All recommendations are given for the midpoint of each Index. For some crops, there are different recommendations depending on whether the soil is in the lower half (2-) or upper half (2+) of K Index 2 •	Where a soil analysis value (as given by the laboratory) is close to the range of an adjacent Index, the recommendation may be reduced or increased slightly, taking account of the recommendation given for the adjacent Index. Small adjustments of less than 10 kg/ha are generally not justified •	Where more or less phosphate and potash are applied than suggested in the tables, adjustments can be made later in the rotation

#### Taking soil samples for pH, phosphorus, potassium,

#### magnesium and sodium

Soil sampling must be done well to avoid misleading results and expensive mistakes. •	The soil in each field should be sampled every 3–5 years •	Take topsoil samples to 15 cm depth using a soil auger •	Collect samples at the same point in the rotation and well before growing a sensitive crop, e.g. sugar beet •	Ideally, sample immediately after the harvest of the previous crop •	Do not sample within six months of a lime or fertiliser application (except nitrogen) and avoid sampling when the soil is very dry •	Do not take samples in headlands, or in the immediate vicinity of hedges, trees or other unusual features •	The soil sample must be representative of the area sampled. Areas of land known to differ in some important respects (e.g. soil type, previous cropping, applications of manure, fertiliser or lime) should be sampled separately. Small areas known to differ from the majority of a field should be excluded from the sample •	Ideally, the sampled area should be no larger than four hectares •	Clean tools before starting and before sampling a new area •	Walk a ‘W’ pattern across the sampling area, stopping at least 25 times •	At each point, collect a subsample (core) to 15 cm depth using a gouge corer or screw auger •	The subsamples should be bulked to form a representative sample and sent to the laboratory for analysis •	Use appropriate packaging (normally available from the laboratory) and label samples clearly, providing as much information about the field and crop as possible Phosphate, potash and magnesium recommendations On soils where acidity is known to occur, more frequent testing may be needed than the four-year cycle used for phosphate, potash and magnesium. Since acidity can occur in patches, spot testing with a soil indicator test across the field is often useful. Soil indicator tests can also be useful on soils which contain fragments of free lime, since these can give a misleadingly high pH when analysed following grinding in the laboratory.

### Sulphur recommendations

There is evidence that brassica crops respond to sulphur. Where sulphur deficiency has been recognised or is expected in vegetable brassicas, apply 50–75 kg/ha SO. There are no UK trials on the sulphur response of other vegetable crops. However, atmospheric sulphur emissions have declined significantly and a yield response to sulphur in other crops is possible. Where sulphur deficiency has been recognised or is expected in other vegetable crops, apply 25 kg/ha SO. Sulphur should be applied as a sulphate-containing fertiliser at, or soon after, planting. Crops are most at risk of sulphur deficiency where they are grown on light sandy soils, soils with a low organic matter content and in high rainfall areas.

### Points to consider

•	Recommendations are given as sulphur trioxide (SO3). Conversion tables (metric–imperial, oxide–element) are given on page 43 •	Don’t forget to make allowance for the crop-available sulphur applied in organic materials (Section 2: Organic materials) •	Further guidance on sulphur can be found in Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use Sulphur recommendations/Micronutrient recommendations

### Micronutrient recommendations

Crop requirements for micronutrients are usually met by supply from the soil. However, they are essential to the plant and, if a deficiency is suspected, it is important to diagnose and treat accordingly. Many soils contain sufficient supplies of micronutrients to achieve potential crop yields. However, the availability of these nutrients for plant uptake can be restricted by other factors, such as:

### •	pH

•	Concentration of other nutrients in the soil •	Poor soil structure, which can impede root growth and nutrient uptake Visual symptoms of a deficiency of a specific micronutrient are often short-lived and can be confused with those caused by other growth problems, i.e. drought, frost or herbicide damage. Furthermore, by the time symptoms appear, it can be too late to correct a deficiency. Consequently, decisions about when to apply micronutrients should be informed by crop and soil risk factors before visual symptoms develop. Soil risk factors are described in Table 6.9 and crop-specific guidance is provided from page 24 onwards. Visual diagnosis of a micronutrient deficiency should be confirmed by leaf and/or soil analysis.

<!-- Page 20 -->

Micronutrient recommendations Table 6.9 Micronutrient deficiencies

| Micronutrient | Soil risk factors | Soil analysis | Leaf analysis | Treating deficiencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Boron (B) | Sandy soils, soils high in organic matter or with a pH above 7 are at risk of boron deficiency. Over-liming can also increase the risk. | Hot water extract: deficiency is more likely below 0.8 mg B/l. | Deficiency is more likely below 20 mg B/kg. | If possible, treat deficiencies with a soil-applied fertiliser prior to planting. Deficiencies can also be treated using a foliar spray at an early growth stage. |
| Copper (Cu) | Soils most at risk of copper deficiency are organic and peat soils in the Fens and leached sandy soils, particularly on reclaimed heathland. Deficiency can occur in shallow soils over chalk with high organic matter, sandy and peat soils. | EDTA extract: deficiency is more likely below 1.0 mg Cu/l, unless soil organic matter is above 6%, when deficiency is more likely below 2.5 mg Cu/l. | Deficiency is more likely below 5 mg Cu/kg Tissue analysis is less reliable than soil analysis for diagnosing deficiencies. | If possible, treat deficiencies with a soil-applied fertiliser prior to planting. Deficiencies can also be treated using a foliar spray of copper oxychloride or cuprous oxide. |
| Manganese (Mn) | Symptoms are often transient. Deficiency can be triggered by over-liming A high soil pH can increase the likelihood of deficiency and all soils above pH 7.5 are at risk. Sandy soils with a pH above 6.5 and organic, peaty or marshland soils above pH 6 are at a greater risk Under-consolidated seedbeds, low soil temperatures and low rainfall can lead to higher risk of deficiency. | Not reliable. | Deficiency is more likely below 20 mg Mn/kg. | Deficiencies can be treated using a foliar spray of manganese sulphate. |
| Molybdenum (Mo) | Soils with pH below 6.5 are at greater risk of molybdenum deficiency. | Ammonium oxalate extract: deficiency is more likely below 0.1 mg Mo/l. | Insufficient information to be able to recommend this type of analysis. | Use a liming material to raise the soil pH of acidic soils to 6.5. When soil pH is more than 7 and when treatment is necessary, apply a soil or foliar treatment of sodium molybdate. |
| Zinc (Zn) | Deficiency is very rare in the UK, however sandy soils with high pH and high phosphate status are more likely to have lower levels of zinc. | EDTA extract: deficiency is more likely below 1.5 mg Zn/l. | Deficiency is more likely below 15–20 mg Zn/kg. | Deficiencies can be treated using soil- or foliar-applied fertilisers. |

### Selecting the most appropriate fertiliser

For a single nutrient, the recommended amount can be applied using a straight fertiliser. Where more than one nutrient is required, a compound or blended fertiliser can be used. In this case, the compound or blend selected will depend on the ratio of the nutrients in the fertiliser and the amount applied should give as near the recommended amount of each nutrient as possible. Often, it will not be possible to exactly match the recommendations with available fertilisers. In most cases, the first priority is to get the amount of nitrogen correct because crops respond most to nitrogen. Slight variation in the rates of phosphate or potash will have less effect on yield, especially on Index 2 soils, and any discrepancy can be corrected in fertiliser applications to future crops. Example 6.5 Bulb onions grown in an SNS Index 3, P Index 2 and K Index 2+ field require 90 kg N/ha, 50 kg PO/ha and 35 kg KO/ha. A 20:10:10 NPK compound fertiliser is available. Applied at 450 kg/ha, this fertiliser will supply 90 kg N/ha, 45 kg PO/ha and 45 kg KO/ha. The deficit of 5 kg PO/ha and surplus of 15 kg KO/ha 2252 are both small and can be ignored. Metric to imperial conversion tables are given on page 43. If applying liquid fertilisers, manufacturers can supply tables which convert kg/ha of nutrient to litres/ha of product.

### Techniques for applying fertiliser

#### Starter fertiliser

The injection of high phosphate liquid fertiliser 2–3 cm below the seed, or around the roots of transplants, can improve the growth and quality of crops, such as bulb and salad onions, lettuce and leeks. Starter fertiliser is particularly useful for crops grown in mixed rotations on soils at P Index 3 or below. However, responses have been found at P Index 4. No more than 20 kg N/ha and 60 kg PO/ha should be applied as starter fertiliser, which may be deducted from the recommended total application. In most experiments, comparable yields with starter fertiliser have been obtained with much lower amounts of nitrogen than when fertiliser has been broadcast. The use of injected liquid starter fertiliser in combination with a supplementary dressing of a conventional fertiliser can increase the overall efficiency of nutrient use and typically reduces the total fertiliser requirement of field vegetables by up to half. Liquid starter fertilisers containing chloride may reduce plant establishment and should be avoided.

#### Band spreading/placement of fertiliser

For some wide-row crops, there can be benefits from applying early nitrogen in a band or injecting it around the plant, followed by a broadcast top dressing. This may reduce the overall amount of nitrogen required. In experiments using the banding approach, yield and quality of cauliflowers was maintained and post-harvest soil nitrogen residues were less, reducing the risk of nitrate leaching. Placement of phosphate fertiliser has been shown to increase yields compared with surface broadcast application on low P Index soils. Where fertiliser is placed, a small reduction in the recommended rate of phosphate could be considered.

a. In year 2, apply 120 kg N/ha by end of February – early March. b. In subsequent years, the amount and timing of nitrogen depends on the previous winter. If the crop is on light soil and over-winter rainfall was high, apply 40–80 kg N/ha by the end of February with an additional 40–80 kg N/ha applied after harvest. Following moderate or low amounts of winter rainfall apply 40–80 kg N/ha just after the harvest to provide nitrogen for fern growth. When SMN is measured, top up with fertiliser nitrogen to achieve a target of 120 kg N/ha of mineral nitrogen in the top 30 cm of soil during the cropping period.

<!-- Page 24 -->

Establishment year – nitrogen Apply one third of the total nitrogen dressing before sowing or planting, one third when the crop is fully established (around mid-June for crowns, mid-July for transplants) and one third at the end of August. Subsequent years – nitrogen In year two, apply 120 kg N/ha by end of February/early March. In subsequent years, the amount and timing of nitrogen depends on the previous winter. If the crop is on light soil and rainfall was high over winter, apply 40–80 kg N/ha by the end of February, with an additional 40–80 kg N/ha applied after harvest. Following moderate or low amounts of winter rainfall, apply 40–80 kg N/ha just after harvest to provide nitrogen for fern growth. Where SMN is measured, top up with fertiliser nitrogen to achieve a target of 120 kg N/ha of mineral nitrogen in the top 30 cm of soil during the cropping period. Sodium Asparagus can respond to applied sodium. Apply up to 500 kg NaO/ha per year at the end of June but not in the establishment year. Sulphur Where sulphur deficiency has been recognised or is expected, apply 25 kg SO/ha as a sulphate-containing fertiliser at, or soon after, planting in the establishment year, and in early spring for established crops. Vegetables

### Points to consider

•	Make allowance for nutrients applied in organic materials (Section 2: Organic materials) •	Ensure the phosphate and potash offtake is balanced by application at P Index 3 and K Index 2+; check that the soil is maintained at these target Indices by soil sampling every 3–5 years

a. On light soils where leaching may occur or when crops are established by direct seeding, no more than 100 kg N/ha should be applied prior to seeding or transplanting. On retentive soils in drier parts of the country where leaching risk is low and spring-planted brassicas are established from modules, more nitrogen can be applied prior to planting. The remainder of the nitrogen requirement should be applied after establishment. b.  A small amount of nitrogen may be needed if soil nitrogen levels are low in the top 30 cm of soil. c. Phosphate and potash requirements are for average crops and it is important to calculate specific phosphate and potash removals based on yields, especially for the larger-yielding cabbage crops. As a general rule for cabbage crops, increase potash application by 40 kg/ha KO for every 10 t/ha fresh weight yield over 40 t/ha.

Where more than one crop is grown in the same year, there should be sufficient residues of phosphate, potash and magnesium for a second crop. The SNS Index for second crops grown in the same season will be between Index 3 and 5, depending on the growing conditions of the first crop. Measurement of Soil Mineral Nitrogen is recommended to determine the SNS Index of the second and third crops grown within the same season (page 15). Minimising nitrate levels EU legislation stipulates nitrate limits for leafy salads, so growers need to ensure nitrogen applications do not cause crops to exceed these limits. This is particularly important for late-season crops of leafy salad, where even small amounts of fertiliser may lead to high tissue nitrate concentration. All leafy salads – sulphur Where sulphur deficiency has been recognised or is expected, apply 25 kg SO/ha as a sulphate-containing fertiliser at, or soon after, planting. Vegetables

### Modifying the crop nitrogen requirement

Vegetable crops are planted at many different times of the year and have a range of expected yields. FACTS Qualified Advisers can customise individual field recommendations using Table 6.22 and the following information: 1. Size of the crop – the size, frame or weight of the crop needed to produce optimal economic yields. 2. Nitrogen uptake – the optimum nitrogen uptake associated with a crop of that size. 3. Supply of nitrogen – based on the nitrogen supply from the soil within rooting depth, including any nitrogen mineralised from organic matter during the growing season. 1. Size of the crop (t/ha Dry weight yield) Dry wt yield = (Fresh wt yield x dm%/100) DW-HI Fresh wt yield (t/ha): The yield of marketable produce removed, or expected to be removed, from the field in commercial practice. Data based on field experiments or expert opinion for well-grown crops. dm %: The % dry matter of marketable produce for optimally fertilised crops. DW-HI: The dry weight-harvest Index is the proportion of the whole crop that is taken for market, expressed on a dry-weight basis. For example, in onions, 81% (0.81) of the green crop is bulb but only 26% (0.26) of the sprout crop is produced as sprouts. Modifying the crop nitrogen requirement 2. Nitrogen uptake in an optimally grown crop (kg/ha) Total N Uptake (kg/ha) = Dry wt yield t/ha x N% x 10 N%: The estimated nitrogen concentration of an optimally fertilised whole plant at harvest. Generally, %N declines as yields increase. For small changes in yield, e.g. if yield increases by 10%, it could be assumed that nitrogen uptake increases by the same amount. For bigger changes, the increase in nitrogen uptake will be less than the increase in yield and the formula below should be used. –0.26W%N = a(1+be) Crit %N: The critical N concentration; a and b are parameters controlling the Crit shape of the curve. W: Total dry matter yield t/ha. 3. Supply of nitrogen and calculation of Crop Nitrogen Requirement (CNR) CNR = (NUptake – MineralisedN + SoilMinN) x (FertRec/100) MineralisedN: The amount of nitrogen released from soil organic matter by mineralisation during the cropping period. This is normally between planting and harvesting dates, but for some crops, such as lettuce and onions where early nitrogen supply is important, a shorter period has been chosen (see Table 6.1). The calculations are based on mineralisation within the WELL_N model (i.e. 0.7 kg/ha at 15.9°C, scaled for Wellesbourne temperature). When temperature is less than 4°C, mineralisation is assumed to be negligible. SoilMinN: Soil Mineral Nitrogen to rooting depth. FertRec: Fertiliser recovery assumed to be 60%.

### Glossary

Available (nutrient)  Form of a nutrient that can be taken up by a crop immediately or within a short period so acting as an effective source of that nutrient for the crop. Clay  Finely divided inorganic crystalline particles in soils, less than 0.002 mm in diameter. Closed period  Period of the year when nitrogen fertilisers or certain manures should not be applied unless specifically permitted. Closed periods apply within NVZs. Content (nutrient) Commonly used instead of the more accurate ‘concentration’ to describe nutrients in fertiliser or organic material. For example, 6 kg N/t often is described as the nitrogen content of a manure. Crop-available The total nitrogen content of organic material that is nitrogen  available for crop uptake in the growing season in which it is spread on land. Crop nitrogen The amount of crop-available nitrogen that must be requirement  applied to achieve the economically optimum yield. Digestate  Organic material produced by anaerobic digestion of biodegradable organic materials. May be separated into liquid and fibre fractions after digestion. Glossary Excess winter Rainfall between the time when the soil profile rainfall  becomes fully wetted in the autumn (field capacity) and the end of drainage in the spring. There is less evapotranspiration during this period (i.e. water lost through the growing crop). FACTS  UK national certification scheme for advisers on crop nutrition and nutrient management. Membership is renewable annually. A FACTS Qualified Adviser has a certificate and an identity card. Fertiliser  See Manufactured fertiliser. Grassland  Land on which the vegetation consists predominantly of grass species. Leaching  Process by which soluble materials such as nitrate or sulphate are removed from the soil by drainage water passing through it. Ley  Temporary grass, usually ploughed up one to five years (sometimes longer) after sowing. Lime requirement  Amount of standard limestone needed in tonnes/ha to increase soil pH from the measured value to a higher specified value (often 6.5 for arable crops). Can be determined by a laboratory test or inferred from soil pH. Liquid fertiliser  Pumpable fertiliser in which nutrients are dissolved in water (solutions) or held partly as very finely divided particles in suspension (suspensions).

<!-- Page 45 -->

Manufactured Any fertiliser that is manufactured by an industrial fertiliser  process. Includes conventional straight and NPK products (solid or fluid), organo-mineral fertilisers, rock phosphates, slags, ashed poultry manure, liming materials that contain nutrients. Manure  See Livestock manure. Micronutrient  Boron, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum and zinc are needed in very small amounts by crops. Cobalt and selenium are taken up in small amounts by crops and are needed in human and livestock diets. Mineral nitrogen  Nitrogen in ammonium (NH) and nitrate (NO) forms. Mineralisation  Microbial breakdown of organic matter in the soil, releasing nutrients in crop-available, inorganic forms. Nitrate vulnerable  Areas designated by Defra as being at risk from zones (NVZs)  agricultural nitrate pollution. Offtake	 Amount of a nutrient contained in the harvested crop (including straw, tops or haulm) and removed from the field. Usually applied to phosphate and potash. Olsen P  Concentration of available P in soil, determined by a standard method (developed by Olsen) involving extraction with sodium bicarbonate solution at pH 8.5. The main method used in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the basis for the soil Index for P. Organic manure  Any bulky organic nitrogen source of livestock, human or plant origin, including livestock manures. Glossary Organic soil  Soil containing between 10% and 20% organic matter (in this Manual). Elsewhere, it sometimes refers to soils with between 6% and 20% organic matter. Peaty soil (peat)  Soil containing more than 20% organic matter. Placement  Application of fertiliser to a zone of the soil usually close to the seed or tuber. Removal  See Offtake. Sand  Soil mineral particles larger than 0.05 mm. Silt  Soil mineral particles in the 0.002–0.05 mm diameter range. SNS Index Soil Nitrogen Supply expressed in seven bands or Indices, each associated with a range in kg N/ha. Soil Index Concentration of available P, K or Mg, as determined (P, K or Mg)  by standard analytical methods, expressed in bands or Indices. Soil Mineral Ammonium and nitrate nitrogen, measured by the Nitrogen (SMN)  standard analytical method and expressed in kg N/ha. Soil Nitrogen The amount of nitrogen (kg N/ha) in the soil that Supply (SNS)  becomes available for uptake by the crop in the growing season, taking account of nitrogen losses.

Glossary Soil organic matter  Often referred to as humus. Composed of organic compounds ranging from undecomposed plant and animal tissues to fairly stable brown or black material with no trace of the anatomical structure of the material from which it was derived. Soil texture  Description based on the proportions of sand, silt and clay in the soil. Soil type  Description based on soil texture, depth, chalk content and organic matter content. Target Soil Index  Lowest soil P or K Index at which there is a high probability crop yield will not be limited by phosphorus or potassium supply. See Soil Index (P, K or Mg).
