### Using the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209)

The Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) helps you make the most of organic materials and balance the benefits of fertiliser use against the costs – both economic and environmental. The guide outlines the value of nutrients and soil, and explains why good nutrient management is about more than just fertilisers. It can save you money as well as help protect the environment. AHDB first published the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) in May 2017. Since its publication, recommendations have been revised, with the latest independent research funded by AHDB and its partners. A list of updates is available at ahdb.org.uk/rb209 To improve the accessibility and relevance of the recommendations and information, the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) is published as seven sections that are updated individually.

### Keep informed

The Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) will be updated regularly. Please email your contact details to comms@ahdb.org.uk so that we can send you notifications of when they are published.

### Checklist for decision-making

Individual decisions for fertiliser use must be made separately for every field. Where more than one crop is grown in a field, these areas must be considered individually. 1. Confirm the crop to be grown and the intended market. Identify any crop quality requirements for this market. 2. Identify the dominant soil type in the cropped area (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use). 3. Assess soil structure and take action to remove compaction and improve drainage if necessary. Poor structure and drainage can restrict crop growth, resulting in poor nutrient use efficiency. 4. Carry out soil analysis for pH, P, K and Mg before planting and every 3–5 years (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use). Target values to maintain when growing fruit, hops or vines are: •	Soil pH 6.0–6.5 (6.5–6.8 before planting) •	Soil P Index 2 •	Soil K Index 2 (cider apples respond to Soil K Index 3) •	Soil Mg Index 2 (cider apples respond to Soil Mg Index 3) 5. Calculate the total and crop-available nutrients from organic materials that have been applied since harvest of the previous crop, or which will be applied to the crop being grown (Section 2: Organic materials). Deduct these nutrients from the recommended rates given in the tables. 6. Use regular leaf and fruit analysis to help make fertiliser decisions. Soil levels are not always reflected in the nutrient concentrations in the leaf and fruit. Checklist for decision-making 7. Decide on the strategy for phosphate, potash and magnesium use. This will be either building up, maintaining or running down the Soil Index levels (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use). Allow for any surplus or deficit of phosphate, potash or magnesium applied to previous crops. 8. Using the tables, decide on the required rate of each nutrient. Decide the optimum timings for fertiliser application, then find the best match for these applications using available fertilisers. 9. Check that the fertiliser spreader or sprayer is in good working order and has been recently calibrated (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use). 10. Keep an accurate record of the fertilisers and organic materials applied.

### Identification of soil category

Careful identification of the soil category in each field is very important. The whole soil profile should be assessed to rooting depth. Where the soil varies, and nitrogen is to be applied uniformly, select the soil type that occupies the largest part of the field. The soil category can be identified using Figure 7.1 which categorises soils on their ability to supply and retain mineral nitrogen. The initial selection can then be checked using Table 7.1. Carefully assess the soil organic matter content when deciding if the soil is organic (10–20% organic matter for the purposes of this guide) or peaty (more than 20% organic matter). If necessary, seek professional advice on soil-type assessments, remembering this will need to be done only once.

Identification of soil category Table 7.1 Soil category assessment

| Soil category | Description of soil types within category | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light sand soils | Soils that are sand, loamy sand or sandy loam to 40 cm depth and are sand or loamy sand between 40–80 cm, or over sandstone rock. | Soils in this category have poor water-holding capacity and retain little nitrogen. |
| Shallow soils | Soils over impermeable subsoils and those where the parent rock (chalk, limestone or other rock) is within 40 cm of the soil surface. Sandy soils developed over sandstone rock should be regarded as light sand soils. | Soils in this category are less able to retain or supply nitrogen at depth. |
| Medium soils | Mostly medium-textured mineral soils that do not fall into any other soil category. These includes sandy loams over clay, deep loams and silty or clayey topsoils that have sandy or loamy subsoils. | Soils in this category have moderate ability to retain nitrogen and allow average rooting depth. |
| Deep clayey soils | Soils with predominantly sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay or clay topsoil overlying clay subsoil to more than 40 cm depth. Deep clayey soils normally need artificial field drainage. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils. |
| Deep silty soils | Soils of sandy silt loam, silt loam or silty clay loam textures to 100 cm depth or more. Silt soils formed on marine alluvium, warp soils (river alluvium) and brickearth soils are in this category. Silty clays of low fertility should be regarded as other mineral soils. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and allow rooting to greater depth. |
| Organic soils | Soils that are predominantly mineral but with between 10–20% organic matter to depth. These can be distinguished by darker colouring that stains the fingers black or grey. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and have higher nitrogen mineralisation potential. |
| Peat soils | Soils that contain more than 20% organic matter derived from sedge or similar peat material. | Soils in this category have very high nitrogen mineralisation potential. |

### Phosphate, potash and magnesium recommendations

For soil-grown crops, the current phosphate, potash and magnesium recommendations are based on achieving and maintaining target Soil Indices. Soil analysis should be done before planting and every 3–5 years in established crops. The use of soil analysis as a basis for making fertiliser decisions and the procedure for taking soil samples is described below. The phosphate and potash recommendations given in the tables are sufficient to replace the crop offtake of established crops at the target Soil Index and, therefore, to maintain the target Soil Index. The amount of phosphate and potash needed to supply maintenance needs will depend on crop uptake and nutrient offtake. Where the soil is below the target phosphate or potash Index, the recommendations given in the tables are higher, to allow the soil to ‘build up’ to the target Index over time. When the soil also needs liming, magnesium can often be supplied cost-effectively by using magnesian limestone. When liming is not required, a magnesium fertiliser should be used. Where magnesium deficiency has been diagnosed, foliar sprays of agricultural magnesium sulphate (Epsom salts) or other proprietary materials are likely to give a more rapid effect than a soil application of a magnesium fertiliser.

### Points to consider

•	Recommendations assume good soil structure, water supply and pest and disease control •	Recommendations are given as phosphate (P2O5), potash (K2O) and magnesium oxide (MgO). Conversion tables (metric–imperial, oxide–element) are given on page 25 •	Organic materials supply phosphate and potash, which contribute to crop requirements. Don’t forget to make allowance for the phosphate and potash applied in organic materials (Section 2: Organic materials) Phosphate, potash and magnesium recommendations •	All recommendations are given for the midpoint of each Index. Where a soil analysis value (as given by the laboratory) is close to the range of an adjacent Index, the recommendation may be reduced or increased slightly, taking account of the recommendation given for the adjacent Index. Small adjustments of less than 10 kg/ha are generally not justified •	Where more or less phosphate and potash are applied than suggested in the tables, adjustments can be made later in the rotation

#### Taking soil samples for pH, phosphate, potassium and magnesium

Soil sampling must be done well to avoid misleading results and expensive mistakes. •	The soil in each field should be sampled before planting and every 3–5 years thereafter •	Ideally, samples should be collected in the spring •	Do not sample within six months of a lime or fertiliser application (except nitrogen) and avoid sampling when the soil is very dry •	Do not take samples in headlands or in the immediate vicinity of hedges, trees or other unusual features •	Before planting, samples should be collected before ploughing so that if lime and/or fertiliser is needed, it can be applied and then ploughed down •	The soil sample must be representative of the area sampled. Areas of land known to differ in some important respects (e.g. soil type, previous cropping, applications of manure, fertiliser or lime) should be sampled separately •	Small areas known to differ from the majority of a field should be excluded from the sample •	Before planting in old herbicide strip orchards, separate samples should be taken from the grass alley and the strip, especially where previous lime and fertiliser applications have been applied to the strip only

### Soil acidity and liming

Most fruit crops are tolerant of slight acidity and grow best at around pH 6.0–6.5. Soil pH levels below about 5.5 can give rise to manganese toxicity, causing ‘measley’ bark in apples and purple veining in some strawberry varieties. Blackcurrants are more susceptible to soil acidity and a pH of at least 6.5 should be maintained. Blueberries are an exception to other fruit, as they require a soil pH of 4.5–5.5. Where soil pH is higher than this, ammonium sulphate can be used to lower the pH, providing the soil does not contain free calcium carbonate. Mature hops can tolerate a considerable degree of soil acidity, but some varieties may suffer from manganese toxicity if the soil becomes too acidic. Young hop plants are more sensitive to acidity. It is important that soils used for fruit, vines and hops are not over-limed as this may lead to micronutrient deficiencies, such as iron and manganese.

#### Liming before planting

Any lime required should be applied and incorporated before planting, see Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use. Because acidity problems occur in patches and acidity can develop rapidly when herbicides are used, the whole plough layer should be limed to maintain a pH value of 6.5 in the early years of fruit or hops. It will be impossible to correct any acidity at depth by later lime incorporation, so the quantity of lime applied before planting should be calculated to correct the pH of the top 40 cm of soil. Where lime is needed to correct acidity in the subsoil, it should be ploughed down. Where sampling has only been carried out to 15 cm depth, the lime requirement using this pH result should be doubled. If the total lime requirement is more than 7.5 t/ha, half should be deeply cultivated into the soil and ploughed down, with the remainder applied and worked in after ploughing. If less than 7.5 t/ha of lime is needed, the whole requirement should be applied after ploughing and cultivated in. Soil acidity and liming On soils where acidity is known to occur, soil may need to be tested more frequently than the four-year cycle used for phosphate, potash and magnesium. Since acidity can occur in patches, spot testing with a soil indicator across the field is often useful. Soil indicators can also be useful on soils which contain fragments of free lime, since these can give a misleadingly high pH when analysed following grinding in the laboratory. Where there is significant variability of soil pH, lime should be applied at different rates in different areas so that the whole field reaches the same pH. If testing with a coloured indicator, or a pH meter shows that the soil pH is less than 5.0 below plough depth, seek further advice before liming or planting.

#### Liming established crops

Under herbicide strip management, the strip will generally become acidic more quickly than the grass alley and may require more frequent liming than the alley. The correction of acidity in undisturbed soil is slow, so it is important to check soil pH regularly and apply lime when necessary before the soil becomes too acidic and a severe problem builds up.

#### Liming materials

Acidic soils deficient in magnesium may be limed with magnesian limestone, particularly before planting. One tonne of magnesian limestone contains at least 150 kg MgO. However, over-application of magnesian limestone can reduce the availability of soil potash. Where soil magnesium levels are satisfactory, ground chalk or limestone should be used. The use of coarse grades of limestone or chalk should be avoided. See Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use for more information on liming rates.

<!-- Page 11 -->

### Sulphur recommendations

Fruit crops are not generally thought to respond to sulphur. However, atmospheric sulphur emissions have declined significantly and a yield response to sulphur is possible in some circumstances. Where sulphur deficiency has been recognised or is expected, apply 15–25 kg/ha SO. Sulphur should be applied as a sulphate-containing fertiliser in the spring. Crops are most at risk of sulphur deficiency where they are grown on light sandy soils, soils with a low organic matter content and in high rainfall areas.

### Points to consider

•	Recommendations are given as sulphur trioxide (SO3). Conversion tables (metric–imperial, oxide–element) are given on page 25 •	Organic materials supply crop-available sulphur, which contributes to crop requirements •	Don’t forget to make allowances for the crop-available sulphur applied in organic materials (Section 2: Organic materials) •	Further guidance on sulphur can be found in Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use Sulphur recommendations/Micronutrients recommendations

### Micronutrients recommendations

Micronutrient deficiencies may occur in fruit, vine and hop crops, especially where the soil pH is over 7.0. These deficiencies can often be identified by visual symptoms, but the diagnosis should be checked by leaf analysis. Iron deficiency cannot reliably be confirmed by leaf analysis. •	Boron (B): boron deficiency in fruit crops is uncommon but can occur in hot dry summers, with pears being most susceptible. Where confirmed, the deficiency can be corrected by foliar application of boron •	Copper (Cu): copper deficiency in pears has been diagnosed on occasion, particularly in orchards on sandy soils. It can be corrected by applying a foliar spray of copper •	Iron (Fe): iron deficiency occurs commonly in fruit crops grown on shallow, calcareous soils. Either soil or foliar application of a suitable iron chelate can be used for treatment •	Manganese (Mn): manganese deficiency can occur in fruit crops grown on calcareous soils or soils with a high pH. It is best controlled by foliar application of manganese •	Zinc (Zn): zinc deficiency has very occasionally been found to reduce growth and cropping of apple trees on sandy soils. This deficiency can be corrected by foliar application of zinc, but applying excessive amounts during blossom or cell division may decrease the number of fruitlets

<!-- Page 13 -->

### Top fruit, established orchards

Nitrogen recommendations are based on the soil management system and soil type. The recommendations are intended as a guide and should be varied according to variety, rootstock, vigour, leaf or fruit analysis and appearance of foliage. Nitrogen dressings can be split across the growing season. The largest demand for nitrogen is between blossom and late July, which corresponds with the rapid shoot growth phase, and nitrogen applications should reflect this. No application should be made during or after leaf drop. The results of leaf and fruit analysis are particularly important. The width of the herbicide strip, the effectiveness of the herbicide programme and use of mulches (e.g. straw) can also influence nitrogen requirements. Straw and composted green waste mulches release potash, which can antagonise calcium uptake. In extreme cases, this can cause physiological fruit disorders, where soil calcium availability is low. Guidance on the use of leaf and fruit analysis to modify recommendations is given on pages 19 and 22, respectively. Applying excess nitrogen encourages vegetative growth, causing large, dark green leaves. This may adversely affect fruit quality, especially taste, firmness and storage quality. Increasing nitrogen reduces the amount of red colour and intensifies the green colour of apples. This effect is detrimental to crop appearance and value in red-coloured varieties but can be beneficial in culinary varieties such as Bramley. Excess nitrogen can also reduce the storage life of fruit. However, autumn foliar application of nitrogen can improve blossom quality in the following spring. When nitrogen is deficient, the leaves of fruit crops tend to be small and pale green, the bark of fruit trees may be reddish in colour and shoot growth restricted. Yields are reduced due to the decrease in the number and size of fruit, which may also be highly coloured. Top fruit, established orchards In grass alley herbicide strip orchards, the tree roots are largely confined to the strip and fertiliser should be applied to the herbicide strip only. The nutrient recommendations given in Table 7.4 are for the complete orchard area and can be reduced where nitrogen is applied to the bare soil area only.

Apple Best Practice Guide apples.ahdb.org.uk

#### Fertigation of young trees

The addition of nutrients to the irrigation water (fertigation) can improve the growth and nutrient use efficiency of trees. Fertigation may be particularly beneficial for early cropping of young apple trees planted on sites previously cropped with apples and may help overcome replanting problems. A benefit is more likely where the soil organic matter level and nitrogen reserves have been depleted by long-term use of herbicides, intended to maintain a bare soil surface. The rate of nitrogen addition should be about 10 g N/tree in the first growing year, increasing to 15–20 g N/tree in the second and third years. Fertigation will allow fertiliser rates to be reduced by up to 50% of that used for broadcast applications in orchards older than three years. It can also help correct nutrient deficiencies, such as phosphate, because nutrients in solution are more rapidly moved down the soil profile. Again, leaf analysis should be used regularly to provide feedback on adjusting nutrition to appropriate levels.

### Points to consider

•	Care should be taken to ensure soils are not completely wetted, to minimise the risk of nitrate leaching

Apple fruit analysis

### Apple fruit analysisFurther information

Analysis of fruit sampled within three weeks of picking is a useful indicator of Apple Best Practice Guide the risk of some physiological disorders in stored apples. Results can also be apples.ahdb.org.uk used to rank orchards for potential storage quality. During the period between sampling for analysis and harvesting the fruit, the concentration of calcium falls Table 7.14 Average nutrient concentrations in Cox, Bramley and Gala apples mainly due to dilution as fruit size increases. Analysing fruit too far in advance (sampled at harvest) of harvest may overestimate the storage potential.

For controlled-atmosphere storage (Cox in 2% oxygen until late February or 1.2% oxygen until cultivar, orchard, farm and sampling date late March; Bramley in 8–10% carbon dioxide until June or 5.0% carbon dioxide plus 1.0% oxygen until July).•	If areas of the orchard have been managed differently, for example as regards soil or tree management or there are areas differing in terms of b.

If fruit analysis produces consistently high or low concentrations of a particular Table 7.15 Average nutrient concentrations in Gala and Braeburn apples (sampled nutrient over 2–3 years, modification of fertiliser application should be two weeks prior to harvest) considered.

•	Gala is naturally low in P compared with Cox, but this does not affect storage potential •	Gala is naturally high in Ca and does not suffer from Ca-dependent storage disorders •	Large concentrations of K in Gala fruit may increase the risk of breakdown •	Gala fruits higher in Ca and lower in K may be firmer ex-store •	Braeburn has a similar composition to Cox, except that K concentration appears lower •	Cox calcium threshold concentrations may be used to judge the storage potential of Braeburn apples Nitrogen (N) – as the nitrogen content increases, fruit becomes more susceptible to rotting, loss of firmness, poor skin finish and a lack of red colour. Above 80 mg N/100 g the risk of disorders in Cox is high. In Bramley, a large nitrogen concentration leads to more green colour but with a risk of lower firmness. Phosphorus (P) – at phosphorus contents below 11 mg P/100 g in Cox, there is an increased risk of fruit losing firmness and developing breakdown, particularly if calcium is also low. In Bramley, the phosphorus threshold for breakdown is lower at 9 mg P/100 g. Potassium (K) – a high potassium content will increase the risk of bitter pit, Gloeosporium rotting and core flush. The risk of bitter pit is also greater if the calcium level is low in relation to potassium. Generally, fruit flavour and acidity increase with increasing levels of potassium. Thus, if calcium levels are adequate (over 5.5 mg Ca/100 g), large concentrations of potassium may be advantageous in terms of fruit quality. Magnesium (Mg) – a high magnesium content will increase the risk of bitter pit, especially when calcium levels are marginal. Apple fruit analysis Calcium (Ca) – calcium levels of 5.0 mg Ca/100 g and above are necessary to maintain high quality throughout long-term storage. However, the storage potential will be modified depending on the content of other elements, especially potassium and phosphorus. Disorders associated with low calcium (bitter pit in particular) are more likely to occur in apples of a given calcium content that are stored in air rather than a controlled atmosphere. Thus, fruit which meets the standards for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium and has a calcium concentration in the range of 4–5 mg Ca/100 g should not be rejected for mid-term controlled-atmosphere storage, as it is unlikely to develop commercially significant levels of bitter pit or breakdown. This much lower risk is reflected by the dual standards for calcium given in the table. The risk of bitter pit and susceptibility to Gloeosporium will depend on the ratio of K:Ca. If the K:Ca ratio is over 30:1 in air-stored Cox or Bramley stored in controlled atmosphere, or over 25:1 in air-stored Bramley, commercially important losses due to bitter pit are likely. Where calcium contents are marginal (3.5–4.0 mg Ca/100 g) and fruit phosphorus is also less than 9.0 mg P/100 g, both Cox and Bramley are more susceptible to breakdown. In such cases, Cox should be marketed early. Bramley should be stored at a higher temperature (average 4.5°C) and sold earlier than fruit with optimum levels of calcium and phosphorus. Gloeosporium risk is dependent on the level of inoculum in the orchard and is influenced by skin finish, fungicide programme and rainfall prior to harvest. Fruit analysis can give an indication of fruit susceptibility to Gloeosporium but not necessarily the eventual amount of rotting. The incidence of senescent breakdown is greatest in late-picked fruit for any given content of phosphorus and calcium. Susceptibility to low-temperature breakdown in Cox stored at 3.0°C (air) and 3.5°C (controlled atmosphere), although less common in Bramley at 4.0°C, is also partly due to low calcium and phosphorus contents.
