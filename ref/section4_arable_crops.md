## Using the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209)

The Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) is funded and supported by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board in conjunction with a range of industry and academic partners. AHDB first published the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) in May 2017, after taking over secretariat and governance for revisions from Defra in November 2014. Since its publication, recommendations have been revised with the latest independent research funded by AHDB and its partners. A list of updates is available at ahdb.org.uk/rb209 To improve the accessibility and relevance of the recommendations and information, the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) is published as seven sections that are updated individually: •	Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use •	Section 2: Organic materials •	Section 3: Grass and forage crops •	Section 4: Arable crops •	Section 5: Potatoes (content last updated 2021) •	Section 6: Vegetables and bulbs (content last updated 2021) •	Section 7: Fruit, vines and hops (content last updated 2017) This section (Section 4) provides guidance for arable crops and should be read in conjunction with Sections 1 and 2. For each crop, recommendations for nitrogen (N), phosphate (P2O5) and potash (K2O) are given in kilograms per 252 hectare (kg/ha). Magnesium (as MgO), sulphur (as SO) and sodium (as NaO) 32 recommendations, also in kg/ha, are given where these nutrients are needed. Recommendations are given for the rate and timing of nutrient application. The recommendations are based on the nutrient requirements of the crop being grown, while making allowance for the nutrients supplied by the soil. Using the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209)

### Further information

The Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) will be updated regularly. Please email your contact details to comms@ahdb.org.uk so that we can send you notifications of when they are published. The Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) supports our farmers, growers, and their trusted advisers to make the most of organic materials and balance the benefits of fertiliser use against the costs – both economic and environmental. The guide outlines the value of nutrients and soil and explains how good nutrient management can save money and infer improved environmental outcomes. The guide aims to increase uptake and accuracy of crop nutrient management planning.

### Disclaimer

Whilst the RB209 guidance may help to inform assessments of pollution prevention and control under national regulations, the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) was not directly developed, nor peer reviewed for this purpose. It should not be relied upon as the sole source of nutrient management guidance for informing environmental assessments.

## Checklist for decision-making

Individual decisions for fertiliser use must be made separately for every field. Where more than one crop is grown in a field, these areas must be considered individually. 1.    Confirm the crop to be grown and the intended market. Identify any crop quality requirements for this market. For the purposes of this guide, winter-sown is defined as sown before 1 February and spring-sown as in February or after. 2.    Identify the dominant soil type in the cropped area (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use). 3.    Assess soil structure and take action to remove soil compaction if necessary. Poor soil structure can restrict crop growth and results in poor nutrient use efficiency. 4.    Carry out soil analysis for pH, P, K and Mg every 3–5 years (page 17). Target values to maintain in arable rotations are: -  Soil pH 6.5 (5.8 on peat soils) -  Soil P Index 2 -  Soil K lower Index 2 (2-) -  Soil Mg Index 2 5.    Identify the soil nitrogen supply (SNS) Index of the field, either by using the Field Assessment Method (page 5) or the Measurement Method (page 11). 6.    Calculate the total and crop-available nutrients from organic materials that have been applied since harvest of the previous crop, or which will be applied to the crop being grown (Section 2: Organic materials). Deduct these nutrients from the recommended rates given in the tables. 7.    Decide on the strategy for phosphate and potash use. This will be building up, maintaining or running down the Soil Index (Section 1: Principles for nutrient management and fertiliser use). Allow for any surplus or deficit of phosphate or potash applied to previous crops in the rotation. 8.    Calculate the amount of phosphate and potash removed in the harvested crop according to targeted crop yield (Table 4.12, page 18). This is the amount of these nutrients that must be replaced in order to maintain the soil at the current Index. Remember that some of these nutrients will also be removed in straw. 9.    Using the tables, decide on the required rate of each nutrient. Decide on the optimum timings for fertiliser application, then find the best match for these applications using available fertilisers. 10.    Check that the fertiliser spreader or sprayer is in good working order and has been recently calibrated (Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use). 11.   Keep an accurate record of the fertilisers and organic materials applied.

### Points to consider

•	Statutory rules that affect nutrient use apply in all parts of the UK. Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) rules apply in England and Scotland, with similar rules in Wales •	Also in England, Farming Rules for Water cover nutrient use generally but particularly the use of nitrogen and phosphate •	In Northern Ireland, Nutrient Action Programme (NAP) rules affect both nitrogen and phosphate use •	All relevant rules should be consulted at an early stage in nutrient management planning to ensure compliance. There can be closed periods and limitations on the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus applied in manufactured fertilisers and organic manures

## Calculating soil nitrogen supply (SNS)

Fields vary widely in the amount of nitrogen available to a crop before any fertiliser or manure is applied. This variation must be taken into account to avoid inadequate or excessive applications of nitrogen. The soil nitrogen supply (SNS) system assigns an Index of 0 to 6 to indicate the likely extent of this background nitrogen supply. The Index is used in the recommendation tables to select the amount of nitrogen, as manufactured fertiliser, manure or a combination of both, that typically would need to be applied to ensure optimum yield. The SNS Index for each field can be estimated either by the Field Assessment Method using records of soil type, previous cropping and winter rainfall, or by the Measurement Method. This uses measurements of soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) plus estimates of nitrogen already in the crop (at the time of soil sampling) and of available nitrogen from the mineralisation of soil organic matter and crop debris during the period of active crop growth. Some field situations are better suited to one particular SNS estimation method (see detail on page 8 and 11).

#### Field Assessment Method

The Field Assessment Method does not take account of the nitrogen that will become available to a crop from any organic manures applied since harvest of the previous crop. The available nitrogen from organic materials applied since harvest of the previous crop, or those that will be applied to the current crop, should be calculated separately using the information in Section 2: Organic materials and deducted from the fertiliser nitrogen application rates shown in the recommendation tables. There are five essential steps to follow to identify the appropriate SNS Index: Step 1. Identify the soil category for the field Step 2. Identify the previous crop Step 3. Select the rainfall range for the field Step 4. Identify the provisional SNS Index using the appropriate table Step 5. Make any necessary adjustments to the SNS Index Calculating soil nitrogen supply (SNS) In detail, these steps are: Step 1. Identify the soil category for the field Careful identification of the soil category in each field is very important. The whole soil profile should be assessed to one-metre depth for arable crops. Where the soil varies and nitrogen is to be applied uniformly, select the soil type that occupies the largest part of the field. The soil type can be identified using Figure 4.1, which categorises soils on their ability to supply and retain mineral nitrogen. The initial selection can then be checked using Table 4.1. Carefully assess the soil organic matter content when deciding if the soil is organic (10–20% organic matter for the purposes of this guide) or peaty (more than 20% organic matter). If necessary, seek professional advice on soil type assessments, remembering this will need to be done only once.

Table 4.1 Soil category assessment

| Soil category | Description of soil types within category | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light sand soils | Soils that are sand, loamy sand or sandy loam to 40 cm depth and are sand or loamy sand between 40–80 cm, or over sandstone rock. | Soils in this category have poor water-holding capacity and retain little nitrogen. |
| Shallow soils | Soils over impermeable subsoils and those where the parent rock (chalk, limestone or other rock) is within 40 cm of the soil surface. Sandy soils developed over sandstone rock should be regarded as light sand soils. | Soils in this category are less able to retain or supply nitrogen at depth. |
| Medium soils | Mostly medium-textured mineral soils that do not fall into any other soil category. These include sandy loams over clay, deep loams, and silty or clayey topsoils that have sandy or loamy subsoils. | Soils in this category have moderate ability to retain nitrogen and allow average rooting depth. |
| Deep clayey soils | Soils with predominantly sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay topsoil overlying clay subsoil to more than 40 cm depth. Deep clayey soils normally need artificial field drainage. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils. |
| Deep silty soils | Soils of sandy silt loam, silt loam or silty clay loam textures to 100 cm depth or more. Silt soils formed on marine alluvium, warp soils (river alluvium) and brickearth soils are in this category. Silty clays of low fertility should be regarded as other mineral soils. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and allow rooting to greater depth. |
| Organic soils | Soils that are predominantly mineral but with between 10–20% organic matter to depth. These can be distinguished by darker colouring that stains the fingers black or grey. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and have higher nitrogen mineralisation potential. |
| Peat soils | Soils that contain more than 20% organic matter derived from sedge or similar peat material. | Soils in this category have very high nitrogen mineralisation potential. |

See page 11 for further information on ‘Low N’ and ‘High N’ grassland.

<!-- Page 11 -->

The Indices shown in Table 4.6 assume that little or no organic materials have been applied. Where silage fields have received the organic manures produced by livestock that have eaten the silage and the manure has been applied in spring, they should be regarded as containing nitrogen residues equivalent to a previous grazing history. ‘Low N’ grassland means average annual inputs of less than 250 kg N/ha in fertiliser plus crop available nitrogen in organic materials used in the last two years, or swards with little clover. ‘High N’ grassland means average annual applications of more than 250 kg N/ha in the last two years, clover-rich swards or lucerne. Step 5: Make any necessary adjustments to the SNS Index When using the Field Assessment Method, it is not necessary to estimate the amount of nitrogen taken up by the crop over winter. This is already taken into account in the tables. Manure history: Where regular applications of organic manures have been made to previous crops in the rotation, increase the Index value by one or two levels, depending on manure type, application rate and frequency of application.

### Point to consider

The nitrogen contribution from manures applied after harvest of the previous crop should not be considered when deciding the SNS Index; this contribution should be deducted from the recommended nitrogen application rate using the information in Section 2: Organic Materials. Field vegetables as previous crop: On medium, deep silty or deep clayey soils, nitrogen residues in predominantly vegetable rotations can persist for several years, especially in the drier parts of the country. This is likely to be especially evident following ‘high’ or ‘medium N vegetables’. The SNS tables make some allowance for this long persistency of nitrogen residues, but the Index level may need to be adjusted upwards, particularly where: •	Winter rainfall is low •	Where the history of vegetable cropping is longer than one year Calculating soil nitrogen supply (SNS) •	In circumstances where larger than average amounts of crop residue or unused fertiliser are left behind (see footnote to Table 4.3) In rotations where vegetable crops are grown infrequently and when there is uncertainty, soil sampling for SMN may be appropriate. Fertiliser residues from previous crop: The Index assessments assume that the previous crop grew normally and that it received the recommended rate of nitrogen applied as fertiliser and/or organic manures. The Index should be increased if there is reason to believe nitrogen residues are likely to be greater than normal and these residues will not be lost by leaching. This could occur where a cover crop was sown in autumn and grew well over winter. The Index may need to be adjusted downwards if there is reason to believe nitrogen residues are likely to be smaller than usual. After any adjustment, the SNS Index can be used in the recommendation tables.

#### Measurement Method

This method is particularly appropriate where the SNS is likely to be large and uncertain. This includes: •	Fields with a history of organic manure application and vegetable rotations where the timing of residue incorporation can strongly affect soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) for the following crop •	Fields where long leys or permanent pasture have been recently ploughed out (but not in the first year after ploughing out) •	Fields where there have been problems such as regular lodging of cereals, very high grain protein or nitrogen contents, or previous crop failure (for example due to drought or disease) •	Fields where there is significant variation in soil texture and/or large amounts of crop residues are incorporated; nitrogen residues also can be large following outdoor pigs The SNS Index can be identified using the results of direct measurement of SMN to 90 cm depth in spring, 60 cm depth in autumn/early winter, or to maximum rooting depth in shallow soils over rock. The crop nitrogen content (at the time of soil sampling) and an estimate of net mineralisable nitrogen must be added to the SMN result when calculating the SNS.

<!-- Page 12 -->

SNS is likely to be low on light sand and shallow soils that have not received regular additions of organic manure or crop residues, particularly in moderate to high rainfall areas. In this scenario, prediction of SNS using the Field Assessment Method is advised. The Measurement Method is not recommended for peat soils or in the first season after ploughing out long leys or permanent pasture, where net mineralisation can be very large and uncertain, and the measured SMN may be a relatively small component of SNS. For these soils, the Field Assessment Method or local experience will be better guides to SNS.

### Points to consider

•	Do not confuse soil nitrogen supply (SNS) and soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) •	SMN is the measured amount of mineral nitrogen (nitrate-N plus ammonium-N) in the soil profile •	The Measurement Method is not suitable for organic and peaty soils as SNS (due to mineralisation of soil organic matter) is unpredictable •	SNS = an estimate of crop N (at time of sampling) + a measurement of SMN + an estimate of subsequent N mineralisation The Measurement Method does not take into account the available nitrogen supplied from organic materials applied after the date of soil sampling for SMN. The available nitrogen from materials applied after sampling should be calculated separately using the information in Section 2: Organic materials and deducted from the nitrogen rate shown in the appropriate recommendation table. The nitrogen contribution from materials applied before sampling for SMN will be largely taken account of in the measured value and should not be calculated separately. When using the Measurement Method, there are four steps to follow: Step 1. Measure soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) Step 2. Estimate nitrogen already in the crop Step 3. Make an adjustment for net mineralisable nitrogen Step 4. Identify soil nitrogen supply (SNS) Index In detail, these four steps are: Step 1. Measure soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) Soil sampling must be done well to avoid misleading results and costly mistakes. Guidance on how to collect and prepare a soil sample for SMN analysis: •	In most situations, sampling in late winter or early spring before nitrogen fertiliser is applied gives slightly better predictions of SNS than sampling in the autumn because overwinter leaching is accounted for, especially in high rainfall areas or on shallow or light sand soils. On soils less prone to leaching, sampling in autumn or early spring is equally effective •	Avoid sampling within two to three months after the application of nitrogen fertiliser or organic manures, or within a month after sowing •	Avoid collecting and sending samples immediately before the weekend or a public holiday •	Areas of land known to differ in some important respects (e.g. soil type, previous cropping, manure or nitrogen fertiliser application) should be sampled separately •	Don’t sample unrepresentative areas, such as ex-manure heaps or headlands •	Samples must be taken to be representative of the area sampled. A minimum of 10–15 soil cores should be taken following a ‘W’ pattern across each field/area to be sampled •	In larger fields (10–20 ha), increase the number of cores to 15–20 unless the soil type is not uniform, in which case more than one sample should be taken. This can be done by dividing the field into smaller blocks from each of which 10–15 soil cores are taken •	Each position should be sampled at three depths in the spring: 0–30 cm, 30–60 cm and 60–90 cm. Sampling to 60 cm is adequate in the autumn •	Samples from each depth should be bulked to form a representative sample of that depth. If the bulk sample is too big, take a representative subsample to send to the laboratory; do not stir the sample excessively •	Use appropriate packaging (normally available from the laboratory) and label samples clearly, providing as much information about the field and crop as possible •	Samples should be analysed within three days of sampling. Samples must be kept cool (2–4˚C) but not frozen during storage or transport

It is important to avoid cross-contamination of samples from different depths. In oilseed rape, the crop contains around 50 kg N/ha for every unit of Green Using a mechanised one-metre-long gouge auger (2.5 cm diameter) is a Area Index (GAI, Table 4.8). For larger canopies (GAI of 2 or more), the crop satisfactory and efficient method, but care must be taken to avoid excessive may contain closer to 40 kg N/ha per unit of GAI.

Large oilseed rape canopies can contain substantial amounts of nitrogen by the spring (in excess of 100 kg N/ha). Research has shown that even for large canopies, all of the N in the crop can be treated as contributing to the SNS. Calculating soil nitrogen supply (SNS)13

However, some soils with an organic matter content above 4% may release little nitrogen, and local knowledge must be used when estimating mineralisable nitrogen. Therefore, it is not possible to specify a routine amount by which to adjust SNS based on soil organic matter level.

Example 4.1 Spring barley (feed) is to be grown on a light sand soil following sugar beet. Annual rainfall is 650 mm. There have been no organic manures applied or grass grown in the last five years. Select Table 4.4 (page 9). On a light sand soil following sugar beet, the SNS Index is 0. Refer to the spring barley recommendation (Table 4.22, page 31), which gives a recommendation of 160 kg N/ha. Example 4.2 3Sugar beet is grown on a medium soil after winter wheat; 30 m/ha of pig slurry (4% DM) was applied in February and incorporated into the soil within six hours. Although the average annual rainfall is 650 mm, in an unusually dry winter, the excess winter rainfall was found to be 100 mm. Since the winter was dry, select Table 4.3 (SNS Indices for low rainfall areas, page 9). On a medium soil after winter wheat, the SNS Index is 1. Refer to the sugar beet recommendation (Table 4.35, page 41), which gives a recommendation of 120 kg N/ha. Since the pig slurry was applied after the harvest of the last crop, its nitrogen contribution must be calculated separately. This manure application provides 65 kg/ha of available nitrogen that is equivalent to manufactured nitrogen fertiliser (Section 2: Organic materials). 120 – 65 = 55 kg N/ha as fertiliser should be applied. Example 4.3 Winter wheat is grown on a medium-textured, low organic matter soil after potatoes, which received some FYM. Annual rainfall is 750 mm. The soil is sampled in early February and analysed for SMN. The analysis report shows that the SMN (0–90 cm) is 115 kg N/ha and the crop nitrogen content is estimated to be 25 kg N/ha. Because the soil contains little organic matter, no extra allowance is made for net mineralisable nitrogen. Therefore, the SNS is 140 kg N/ha. Refer to Table 4.10 (page 14), which shows the SNS Index is 4. Refer to the winter wheat recommendation (Table 4.17, page 26), which gives a recommendation of 120 kg N/ha for a medium soil. Calculating soil nitrogen supply (SNS) Example 4.4 Winter barley is to be sown following a three-year pure grass ley which has been managed in the last two years using 280 kg/ha/year nitrogen as manufactured fertiliser and crop-available N from manures. An average application of slurry has been applied in early spring each year before taking one cut of silage followed by grazing. The soil is a medium soil in a moderate rainfall area. The previous grass management is classed as ‘high N’. Using Table 4.6 (page 10) for medium soils, select the category ‘3–5 year leys, high N, 1 cut then grazed’. The SNS Index appropriate for the winter barley crop is Index 2. If regular applications of bulky organic manures had been applied in previous years, the Index value could be increased by one or two levels. In this case, slurry was applied. The SNS Indices for the next two crops following the winter barley are Index 2 and Index 1, respectively. Example 4.5 Winter wheat is to be sown following spring barley that followed a two-year grazed ley which has been managed using 300 kg/ha/year nitrogen as manufactured fertiliser and crop-available N from manures. The soil is a deep clay in a high rainfall area. Using Table 4.5 (page 10), the SNS Index would be 1. Using Table 4.6 (page 10), the previous grass management is classed as ‘high N, grazed’. The SNS Index from this Table is 2. The higher of these two Indices from Tables 4.5 and 4.6 is 2 and this should be used for the recommendation tables.

## Phosphate, potash and magnesium

## recommendations

Current phosphate, potash and magnesium recommendations are based on achieving and maintaining target Soil Indices for each nutrient in the soil throughout the crop rotation. Soil analysis should be done every 3–5 years. This is now a requirement for England under Defra Farming Rules for Water. The use of regular soil analysis as a basis for making fertiliser decisions and the procedure for taking soil samples is described on page 17. The phosphate and potash recommendations shown at Index 2 and 2-, respectively, are those required to replace the offtake and maintain target Soil Indices. The larger recommended applications for soils at Index 0 and 1 will bring the soil to Index 2 over a number of years. However, top dressing to the soil surface should be avoided where there is a high risk of run-off into neighbouring watercourses. By not applying fertiliser or manures at Index 3 or above, soil will run down over a number of years to the target Index. Phosphate and potash recommendations shown in this guide are those required to replace the offtake of the yield shown. The recommendation should be increased or decreased where yields are expected to be substantially more or less than this. The amount to apply can be calculated using records of yield and crop nutrient contents per tonne of yield determined by analysis, or assuming guide values given in Table 4.12 (page 18). Recommendations are appropriate where the phosphate or potash balance for preceding crops has been close to neutral. Adjustments can be made where the balance for the preceding crop was significantly positive or negative. This might occur where actual yields were substantially different from those expected or where there was a change of plan on straw removal. A phosphate or potash ‘holiday’ can result in a need for greater than normally recommended amounts for following crops.

### Points to consider

•	Recommendations assume good soil structure, water supply and pest and disease control •	Recommendations are given as phosphate (P2O5), potash (K2O)52 and magnesium oxide (MgO). Conversion tables (metric–imperial, oxide–element) are given on page 46 •	Organic materials supply phosphate and potash, which contribute to crop requirements. Don’t forget to make allowance for the phosphate and potash applied in organic materials (Section 2: Organic materials) •	All recommendations are given for the midpoint of each Index. For some crops, there are different recommendations depending on whether the soil is in the lower half (2-) or upper half (2+) of K Index 2 •	Where a soil analysis value (as given by the laboratory) is close to the range of an adjacent Index, the recommendation may be reduced or increased slightly, taking account of the recommendation given for the adjacent Index. Small adjustments of less than 10 kg/ha are generally not justified •	Where more or less phosphate and potash are applied than suggested in the tables, adjustments can be made later in the rotation

a. Values are per tonne of grain or seed removed but include nutrients in straw when this is also removed without weighing. Note that potash content of straw can decrease substantially Crop phosphate and potash requirements at different Indices between maturity and harvest. It can, therefore, be worthwhile to determine the nutrient content of representative straw samples by laboratory analysis.Soil P and K status is best monitored through soil analysis used alongside crop requirements to generate P and K recommendations. Recommendations in b. The straw yield is assumed to be 50% of the grain yield. Where the amount of cereal straw removed is known, offtakes can be calculated using typical values of 1.2 kg PO/t and  Table 4.13 and 4.14 (page 22) are based around phosphate and potash 25 9.5 kg KO/t of straw for winter wheat/barley and 1.5 kg PO/t and 12.5 kg KO/t for spring 2252offtakes in the harvested crop.

For oilseed rape, typical offtake values are 2.2 kg PO/t and 13 kg KO/t  252 average, the crop removed more P and K, which must be replaced if the soil is of straw. at or below the target Index.

<!-- Page 19 -->

If the soil is at target Index (2 for P and 2- for K), only maintenance applications should be made to replace offtakes (Table 4.12 or from grain analysis). If the soil is above the target Index, phosphate or potash applications can be reduced or omitted to allow the Index to decrease over years. However, yield responses are likely where the Soil Index is lower than the target. In such cases, phosphate and/or potash should be applied annually, and soil P and K Indices should be built up through the application of more phosphate or potash than the crop offtake. Further information on building up or running down soil P and K Indices can be found in Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use. If the soil analysis shows that a particular field is on the borderline between two Indices, P and K rates can be fine-tuned by interpolation, for example by averaging recommendations for Indices 0 and 1. Example 4.6 Using typical nutrient contents from Table 4.12, estimate P and K offtake in winter wheat. Winter wheat yields 10 t/ha of grain. Straw is baled and removed from the field. Offtake = yield (t) x grain and straw offtake (kg of nutrient/t) Phosphate offtake  =  10 x 7.0 =  70 kg PO/ha Potash offtake  = 10 x 10.5 =  105 kg KO /ha Example 4.7 Using nutrient contents from laboratory analysis and conversion factors (on page 46), estimate nutrient removal. Laboratory analysis shows that the grain P content was 0.45% and grain K was 0.40% from a winter wheat crop yielding 10 t/ha, with straw incorporated. Nutrient removal = yield x grain P/K content x conversion factor Phosphate = 10 x 0.45 x 19.5 = 88 kg PO /ha Potash = 10 x 0.40 x 10.2 = 41 kg KO /ha Sulphur and sodium recommendations

## Sulphur and sodium recommendations

Sulphur and sodium recommendations are given for each crop, where appropriate, because they are not required by all crops or in all parts of England and Wales. Farmers are advised to monitor the sulphur requirements of their crops because the risk of sulphur deficiency is increasing as atmospheric deposition of sulphur declines. Organic manures can supply useful amounts of sulphur (Section 2: Organic materials). All sulphur recommendations are given as SO, and sodium recommendations 3 as NaO. Conversion tables (metric–imperial, oxide–element) are given on  2 page 46. If applying liquid fertilisers, manufacturers can supply tables which convert kg/ha of nutrient to litres/ha of product.

<!-- Page 20 -->

## Leaf analysis

Suspected nutrient deficiencies based on the appearance of symptoms can be confirmed by leaf nutrient analysis. In such cases, the leaf nutrient concentrations will usually be well below the normal range, and there should, therefore, be little doubt about the diagnosis. Interpretation of laboratory results is possible by comparison with normal levels expected for the crop. Values presented in this guide are based on the best information available.

#### Guidance on how to collect a leaf tissue sample

It is essential to collect leaf samples that accurately reflect the nutritional status of the crop submitted for analysis. Therefore, to adequately represent any field or smaller area of crop, the following sampling procedure should be followed: •	If possible, collect samples early in the season at stem extension rather than after symptoms become visible •	It is recommended to take two tissue samples approximately two weeks apart to help distinguish between permanent and transient sulphur deficiency •	Samples should not be taken from crops that have recently been sprayed with nutrients or fungicides •	Avoid collecting and sending samples immediately before the weekend or a public holiday •	If areas of fields differ significantly, sample each separately •	Walk a ‘W’ pattern across the sampling area, stopping at least 25 times •	At each point, collect the youngest fully expanded leaf from 2–3 plants •	Ensure there is no soil contamination •	Do not sample diseased or dead plants, those damaged by insects and mechanical equipment or stressed by extremes of cold, heat or moisture •	Dry any wet leaves and immediately send them to a laboratory between sheets of paper towel •	Use appropriate packaging (normally available from the laboratory) and label samples clearly, providing as much information about the field and crop as possible •	Do not post fresh material in an airtight container •	Send by overnight courier or deliver directly to the analytical laboratory

## Selecting the most appropriate fertiliser

For a single nutrient, the recommended amount can be applied using a traight fertiliser. Where more than one nutrient is required, a compound or blended fertiliser can be used. In this case, the compound or blend selected will depend on the ratio of the nutrients in the fertiliser, and the amount applied should give as near the recommended amount of each nutrient as possible. Often, it will not be possible to exactly match the recommendations with available fertilisers. In most cases, the first priority is to get the amount of nitrogen correct because crops respond most to nitrogen. Slight variation in the rates of phosphate or potash will have less effect on yield, especially on Index 2 soils, and any discrepancy can be corrected in fertiliser applications to future crops. The approximate nutrient content of commonly used fertilisers is described on page 47. Selecting the most appropriate fertiliser/Cereals

## Cereals

#### All cereals – phosphate, potash, magnesium and sulphur

Phosphate and potash The amounts of phosphate and potash needed to replace offtake and maintain the soil at the target Index (P Index 2 and K Index 2-) are shown in Table 4.13 and Table 4.14. Table 4.13 shows the maintenance applications for each crop when straw is incorporated. Table 4.14 shows the maintenance applications when straw is removed (and with straw yield assumed to be 50% of grain yield). The amounts of phosphate and potash are appropriate to the grain yields shown for each crop in the table. The phosphate and potash recommendations can be adjusted if yields are likely to be larger or smaller than those shown. To adjust the amounts, multiply the difference in expected grain yield by the phosphate and potash content per tonne of grain yield using the appropriate value for where straw is either incorporated or removed, as given in Table 4.12. Then add this value to (for larger yields), or subtract from (for smaller yields), the amounts in Table 4.13. Example 4.8 At P Index 1, the phosphate recommendation for wheat with an expected yield of 10 t/ha where straw is incorporated is 80 + (2 x 6.5) = 93 kg/ha. Where the weight of straw to be removed can be estimated separately, use the amounts of phosphate and potash per tonne of straw shown in the footnotes of Table 4.12 to calculate the amounts removed in the straw. Add these to the appropriate amounts for grain yield in order to calculate the overall amounts removed. Crops grown on soil at Index 0 and 1 would be expected to respond to the higher amounts of phosphate and potash shown in the table. Over a number of years, these extra amounts of fertiliser will help to raise most soils, except light sands, to Index 2. At Index 3 and above, no phosphate and potash need to be applied, but analyse soil regularly. At Index 2, phosphate and potash can be applied when convenient during the year, but at Index 0 and 1, they should be applied annually and worked into the seedbed. To avoid damage to germinating seedlings, do not combine drill more than 150 kg/ha of nitrogen plus potash on sandy soils.

MagnesiumUsing sulphur to maximise quality Further clarity on application rates has been provided by AHDB trials that have At Mg Index 0, magnesium fertiliser should be applied every 3–4 years shown that acrylamide formation can be minimised by applying 50 kg SO/ha at 50–100 kg MgO/ha.3 to sulphur-deficient wheat grown for flour milling or cereal foods. Sulphur Acrylamide is a processing contaminant that has been found in cooked foods. Not all cereal crops will require sulphur, and the responsiveness of a crop It can form during high-temperature cooking and processing of wheat. to the application of sulphur is dependent on soil texture and winter rainfall. Acrylamide formation in wheat-based products is linked to the levels of the amino acid asparagine. AHDB trials have shown that asparagine levels, and hence acrylamide formation, can increase if wheat is sulphur-deficient. Processors have modified their methods to minimise the formation of acrylamide, but growers can also minimise formation by applying sulphur where deficiency is likely. In addition to reducing acrylamide formation, AHDB trials have shown that the loaf volume and malting quality of wheat can be improved by correctly fertilising with sulphur. Table 4.15 Estimating the risk of sulphur deficiency for cereal crops

| Soil texture | Winter rainfall (Nov–Feb) |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Low (<175 mm) | Medium (175–375 mm) | High (>375 mm) |
| Sandy | High | High | High |
| Loamy and coarse silty | Low | High | High |
| Clay, fine silty or peaty | Low | Low | High |

the deficiency should be treated. There are a number of laboratory analyses that can be used to detect sulphur deficiency in leaf tissue, but AHDB trials have shown that the malate:sulphate test is the most reliable. Where deficiency has been recognised or is expected in winter- or spring-sown cereals, apply 25–50 kg/ha SO as a sulphate-containing  3 fertiliser between early March to the end of April for all cereals, taking into account the drilling date.

### All cereals – micronutrientsPoints to consider

AHDB research has shown that the most common micronutrient deficiencies •  The amounts of phosphate and potash are appropriate to the limiting the productivity of cereals crops are copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and grain yields shown zinc (Zn), see Table 4.16. More information is provided in Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use.•  Make allowance for nutrients applied in organic manures ()Section 2: Organic materials Visual symptoms are usually the first sign of a deficiency (Figure 4.5). •  Ensure the phosphate and potash offtake is balanced by application  However, they can be short-lived and easily confused, and by the time on Index 2 soilssymptoms appear, it can be too late to correct the deficiency. •  Check that the soil is maintained at Index 2 by soil sampling every  Table 4.16 Nutrient deficiency risk factors and interpretation of soil and leaf analysis

| Nutrient | Soil risk factor | Soil analysis | Leaf analysis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Manganese (Mn) | Under-consolidated seedbeds; low soil temperature; low rainfall; over-liming; any soil with pH above 7.5; sandy soils with pH above 6.5; organic, peaty or marshland soil with pH above 6.0 | Not reliable | Deficiency is more likely below 20 mg Mn/kg |
| Copper (Cu) | Shallow soils over chalk with high organic matter; sandy and peat soils | EDTA extract: deficiency is more likely below 1.0 mg Cu/l, unless soil organic matter is above 6%, when deficiency is more likely below 2.5 mg Cu/l | Not reliable |
| Zinc (Zn) | Sandy soils with high pH and phosphate Index (Index 5 and higher) | EDTA extract: deficiency is more likely below 1.5 mg Zn/l | Deficiency is more likely below 15 mg Zn/kg |

<!-- Page 25 -->

Treating micronutrient deficiencies Options largely depend on when the deficiency is diagnosed. If soil analysis confirms a deficiency early in the season, liming, seed treatments, seedbed fertilisers or autumn applications are possible. If tissue analysis confirms a deficiency later in the season, treatments will be limited to foliar-applied fertilisers. Copper Symptoms of copper deficiency include pale, twisted leaves and stunted plants. Ears are sometimes trapped in the leaf sheath, and those that emerge have white tips and blind grain sites. Blackening of the ears and straw occurs in copper-deficient wheat on organic chalk soils. This symptom is not seen in wheat grown on sandy or peat soils. Awns of barley become white and brittle, and purpling of the stem and nodes is also possible. If possible, treat deficiencies using soil-applied fertilisers in the autumn. Depending on soil application rate and soil texture, copper treatments may be effective in raising soil copper levels for up to 10 years; regular soil analysis, every 3–5 years, is recommended. Deficiencies can also be treated using foliar-applied fertilisers at late tillering or early stem extension. Manganese Symptoms occur in new leaves, which become pale and limp. This is followed by light grey flecking and striping, which occurs at the base of the youngest fully opened leaf. In time, leaves become paler and eventually become necrotic and collapse. Deficiencies can be treated using seed treatments or foliar-applied fertilisers. Zinc Symptoms of zinc deficiency include pale stripes appearing parallel to the midpoint of younger leaves. Affected tissue dies and turns pale brown. Deficiencies can be treated using seed treatments or soil- or foliar-applied fertilisers. Foliar nutrients can be applied most cost-efficiently by tank-mixing with other crop inputs, such as fungicides, but check product labels carefully for product compatibility.

The N requirements of triticale are the same as those of wheat in most If you farm in an NVZ, you will be expected to have written evidence from at situations. Hence N recommendations should be calculated as for feed wheat, least two previous crops. If you don’t farm in an NVZ, then a sensible approach including the adjustment for yield potential, with the following exceptions: would be to take the last five years’ field-specific yields, discard the highest and lowest and take an average of the remaining three years.•	If the variety chosen is known to have a high lodging risk, the total N rate should be reduced by 40 kg N/ha Where previous experience of growing wheat indicates that yields above •	If the grain price is expected to be significantly below that which 8 t/ha can be realistically expected, increasing the recommended rate by would be received for wheat, N rates should be reduced accordingly 10 kg N/ha for each 0.5 t/ha additional yield, up to a maximum of 13 t/ha, could be justified. Similarly, for low-yielding crops, the recommended rate could be reduced by 10 kg N/ha for each 0.5 t/ha reduction in expected yield.

Wheat – use of grain nitrogen concentration Farm nitrogen strategies for wheat can be assessed periodically using information on grain protein concentration. Grain protein at the economic optimum rate of nitrogen is about 11% (1.9% N) for feed wheat and 12% (2.1% N) for bread-making wheat. Where concentrations in yields from a number of adjacent fields are consistently above or below these values during several years, nitrogen fertiliser application rates should be adjusted down or up by 25 kg N/ha per 0.5% difference in grain protein (30 kg N/ha per 0.1% difference in grain %N). To convert grain %protein to grain %N, divide %protein by 5.7. Both N and protein are reported on a 100% dry matter basis. The effect of economic changes on nitrogen rates The recommendations in the tables for wheat and barley are based on a break-even ratio of 5.0 (cost of fertiliser nitrogen as £/kg N divided by value of grain as £/kg). If the price of nitrogen or the price of grain changes, use Table 4.25 (page 33) to decide on an amount to add to or subtract from the fertiliser nitrogen application. Wheat grown for bread making Generally, an application of nitrogen will be economically worthwhile to boost the grain protein concentration to meet market specifications. Key considerations The decision to apply additional N should be based on: 1. First following recommendations for fertilising adequately for yield 2. The value of the economic premium for meeting the protein threshold 3. The farm’s past success in meeting the required grain quality specification 4. Uptake of previously applied nitrogen if in a low spring rainfall season Typically, applying an extra 40 kg N/ha could increase grain protein by up to 0.5%. Applying an extra 80 kg N/ha may increase grain protein by up to 1%. Soil-applied nitrogen should be applied during stem extension between GS32 and GS39. Later applications can increase protein further, but there is a risk of dry soil conditions reducing N uptake and effectiveness. If soils are drying and/or rainfall is not forecast, then applications should be brought forward. This nitrogen may give a small yield increase as well as an increase in grain protein. Cereals Late foliar urea application during the milky ripe stage (GS73) is generally better at increasing grain protein than soil-applied nitrogen but cannot be expected to increase yield. Recent trial work has shown the application of foliar urea has no detrimental impact on baking quality in comparison to soil applied nitrogen.

### Points to consider

•	Tables contain the total nutrient required – remember to deduct nutrients applied as organic materials (Section 2: Organic materials) •	All relevant rules should be consulted at an early stage in nutrient management planning to ensure compliance. There can be limitations on the amounts of nitrogen applied in manufactured fertilisers and organic manures

#### Yield variationOilseed rape, autumn-sown – nitrogen

The recommendations are for crops yielding 3.5 t/ha. Where previous Table 4.30 Nitrogen for autumn- and winter-sown oilseed rape experience of growing the crop indicates that yields above 3.5 t/ha can be

| Season | Soil category | N recommendation (kg N/ha) |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | SNS Index |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| Autumn | All soils | 30 | 30 | 30 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Winter | All other mineral soils | 220 | 190 | 160 | 120 | 80 | 40–80 | 0–40 |

|  | Peaty soils | – | – | – | – | – | 40–80 | 40–80 |

Timing of application Autumn nitrogen can be applied to the seedbed or as a top dressing to encourage autumn growth, but research suggests that crops sown after early September are unlikely to respond. If the green area index (GAI) of the canopy, measured towards the end of winter, is less than 1.5, or less than 2.0 if the SMN in the top 60 cm soil is less than 25 kg N/ha, apply the nitrogen in two equal splits. Apply half at the start of spring growth (end February–early March) and half at green bud (mid-March to early April). Any additional nitrogen for crops yielding above 3.5 t/ha should be applied between yellow bud and early flowering. Where the GAI of the canopy, measured towards the end of winter, is greater than 2.0, or greater than 1.5 with an SMN in the top 60 cm soil of at least 25 kg N/ha, then the first nitrogen should be reduced to between zero and 40 kg N/ha. Foliar N applied as a solution of urea (20 kg N per 100 litres) at 40 kg N/ha between mid-flowering and two weeks after the end of flowering will often increase gross output by an average of 0.25 t/ha. This may occur even where the optimum amount of nitrogen has been applied to soil. The temperature at application should be less than 19˚C. The economic benefit of this treatment will depend upon the cost of the product and the price of oilseed rape. Note that this foliar-applied nitrogen contributes towards the N max allowance.

Timing of application Apply all the nitrogen in the seedbed. On light sand soils where the total rate is more than 80 kg N/ha, the dressing should be split, with 50 kg N/ha in the seedbed and the remainder by early May.

#### Sunflower – nitrogen

Due to the deep-rooting nature of sunflowers, they can remove nutrients from depth in the soil profile. As a result, the crop will yield satisfactorily at quite low levels of soil nitrogen, and nitrogen fertiliser applications may be unnecessary. High levels of nitrogen can lead to excessive vegetative development, encouraging disease, delaying maturity and reducing seed oil content. UK experience indicates that applications of more than 25–50 kg/ha are rarely required. Oilseeds39

Various agricultural by-products may be used for energy generation, such as These values refer to crops harvested in January; it is now common for crops to be harvested incineration of cereal straw for electricity generation or anaerobic digestion of later (e.g. April–May) and the offtake of potash then is generally less because rainfall leaches out potash from the standing crop and returns it to the soil.animal slurry for biogas generation. One of the main reasons for growing energy crops is to reduce the use of fossil There have been no published studies to test crop responses to different fuels and decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, it is logical to applications of phosphate or potash, and only a few with nitrogen. Nitrogen ensure that GHG emissions associated with growing energy crops, directly or and phosphate offtakes are small compared with many other crops, because indirectly, are kept to a minimum.much nitrogen and phosphate is transferred from stems and leaves to the rhizomes before harvest; these nutrients can be reused in future years.Nitrogen fertilisers lead to large emissions of GHGs, carbon dioxide (CO)  2 and nitrous oxide (NO), during manufacture, and additional NO when applied As well as the nutrients removed in the harvested parts of the crop, an 22 to soil.

For Miscanthus growing in Table 4.38. on soil previously under arable crops, and with little previous organic manure Table 4.38 Nitrogen, phosphate and potash for willow (i.e. in SNS Index 2 or below), the soil is likely to supply about 40 kg N/ha

However, the quantity of nitrogen removed in these years is less than in For short-rotation coppice willow, there is even less experimental data on subsequent years, so it is likely that no additional nitrogen for rhizome nutrient requirements than for Miscanthus. Therefore, the recommendations development is required.

In situations where biomass crops are used for bioremediation of biosolids or biofiltration of effluents, levels of nutrient application in excess of those highlighted in Table 4.38 may be justified, recognising the relatively low environmental risks associated with this approach, relative to alternative methods of disposal. In such circumstances, careful monitoring of ground and surface water is required to demonstrate absence of leaching and/or surface run-off of N and P. Phosphate Maintain soil at P Index 1. Check every three years (i.e. each harvesting cycle) by soil testing. Potash Maintain soil at K Index 1. Check every three years (i.e. each harvesting cycle) by soil testing. Nitrogen As with Miscanthus, a combination of nitrogen mineralised from soil organic matter plus that from atmospheric deposition and rain will supply much of the modest nitrogen requirement. The requirement is about 30 kg N/ha per year for a typical UK crop yielding 30 t dry biomass during a three-year cycle, i.e. 90 kg N/ha total offtake. However, larger offtakes have been observed in some situations and, as a grower gains experience of yields in specific soil types and different environments, nitrogen applications can be adjusted using the values in Table 4.38 for nitrogen removed per tonne dry biomass. Applications of organic materials such as FYM, slurry or sewage sludge are an ideal way of maintaining a suitable supply of nitrogen and other nutrients throughout the three-year growth cycle from a single application made in the first year. The amount applied should be determined on the basis of estimated crop requirement or within the limits described above for bioremediation or biofiltration systems. Biomass crops45

## Analysis of fertilisers and liming materials

The materials listed below are used individually and some are used as components of compound or multi-nutrient fertilisers. The chemical and physical forms of nutrient sources, as well as growing conditions, can influence the effectiveness of fertilisers. A FACTS Qualified Adviser can give advice on appropriate forms for different soil and crop conditions. The reactivity, or fineness of grinding, of liming materials determines their speed of action. However, the amount of lime needed is determined mainly by its neutralising value.
